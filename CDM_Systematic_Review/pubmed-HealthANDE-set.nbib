AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of 
      Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2019. 
      METHOD: A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and 
      free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind 
      review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then 
      peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus 
      meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was organized to 
      finally conclude on the selected three best papers. RESULTS: Among the 517 
      papers, published in 2019, returned by the search, that were in the scope of the 
      various areas of CRI, the full review process selected three best papers. The 
      first best paper describes the use of a homomorphic encryption technique to 
      enable federated analysis of real-world data while complying more easily with 
      data protection requirements. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate 
      the evidence value of federated data networks reporting a large real world data 
      study related to the first line treatment for hypertension. The third best paper 
      reports the migration of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event 
      reporting system database to the OMOP common data model. This work opens the 
      combined analysis of both spontaneous reporting system and electronic health 
      record (EHR) data for pharmacovigilance. CONCLUSIONS: The most significant 
      research efforts in the CRI field are currently focusing on real world evidence 
      generation and especially the reuse of EHR data. With the progress achieved this 
      year in the areas of phenotyping, data integration, semantic interoperability, 
      and data quality assessment, real world data is becoming more accessible and 
      reusable. High quality data sets are key assets not only for large scale 
      observational studies or for changing the way clinical trials are conducted but 
      also for developing or evaluating artificial intelligence algorithms guiding 
      clinical decision for more personalized care. And lastly, security and 
      confidentiality, ethical and regulatory issues, and more generally speaking data 
      governance are still active research areas this year.

TI  - OMOP CDM Can Facilitate Data-Driven Studies for Cancer Prediction: A Systematic 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231911834 [doi]
LID - 11834
AB  - The current generation of sequencing technologies has led to significant advances 
      in identifying novel disease-associated mutations and generated large amounts of 
      data in a high-throughput manner. Such data in conjunction with clinical routine 
      data are proven to be highly useful in deriving population-level and 
      patient-level predictions, especially in the field of cancer precision medicine. 
      However, data harmonization across multiple national and international clinical 
      sites is an essential step for the assessment of events and outcomes associated 
      with patients, which is currently not adequately addressed. The Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) is an internationally 
      established research data repository introduced by the Observational Health Data 
      Science and Informatics (OHDSI) community to overcome this issue. To address the 
      needs of cancer research, the genomic vocabulary extension was introduced in 2020 
      to support the standardization of subsequent data analysis. In this review, we 
      evaluate the current potential of the OMOP CDM to be applicable in cancer 
      prediction and how comprehensively the genomic vocabulary extension of the OMOP 
      can serve current needs of AI-based predictions. For this, we systematically 
      screened the literature for articles that use the OMOP CDM in predictive analyses 
      in cancer and investigated the underlying predictive models/tools. Interestingly, 
      we found 248 articles, of which most use the OMOP for harmonizing their data, but 
      only 5 make use of predictive algorithms on OMOP-based data and fulfill our 
      criteria. The studies present multicentric investigations, in which the OMOP 
      played an essential role in discovering and optimizing machine learning 
      (ML)-based models. Ultimately, the use of the OMOP CDM leads to standardized 
      data-driven studies for multiple clinical sites and enables a more solid basis 
      utilizing, e.g., ML models that can be reused and combined in early prediction, 
      diagnosis, and improvement of personalized cancer care and biomarker discovery.

TI  - Seamless EMR data access: Integrated governance, digital health and the OMOP-CDM.
LID - 10.1136/bmjhci-2023-100953 [doi]
LID - e100953
AB  - Objectives In this overview, we describe theObservational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), the established governance processes 
      employed in EMR data repositories, and demonstrate how OMOP transformed data 
      provides a lever for more efficient and secure access to electronic medical 
      record (EMR) data by health service providers and researchers.Methods Through 
      pseudonymisation and common data quality assessments, the OMOP-CDM provides a 
      robust framework for converting complex EMR data into a standardised format. This 
      allows for the creation of shared end-to-end analysis packages without the need 
      for direct data exchange, thereby enhancing data security and privacy. By 
      securely sharing de-identified and aggregated data and conducting analyses across 
      multiple OMOP-converted databases, patient-level data is securely firewalled 
      within its respective local site.Results By simplifying data management processes 
      and governance, and through the promotion of interoperability, the OMOP-CDM 
      supports a wide range of clinical, epidemiological, and translational research 
      projects, as well as health service operational reporting.Discussion Adoption of 
      the OMOP-CDM internationally and locally enables conversion of vast amounts of 
      complex, and heterogeneous EMR data into a standardised structured data model, 
      simplifies governance processes, and facilitates rapid repeatable 
      cross-institution analysis through shared end-to-end analysis packages, without 
      the sharing of data.Conclusion The adoption of the OMOP-CDM has the potential to 
      transform health data analytics by providing a common platform for analysing EMR 
      data across diverse healthcare settings.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI200138 [doi]
AB  - Data integration is an important task in medical informatics and highly impacts 
      the gain out of existing health information data. These tasks are using 
      implemented as extract transform and load processes. By introducing HL7 FHIR as 
      an intermediate format, our aim was to integrate heterogeneous data from a German 
      pulmonary hypertension registry into an OMOP Common Data Model. First, domain 
      knowledge experts defined a common parameter set, which was subsequently mapped 
      to standardized terminologies like LOINC or SNOMED-CT. Data was extracted as HL7 
      FHIR Bundle to be transformed to OMOP CDM by using XSLT. We successfully 
      transformed the majority of data elements to the OMOP CDM in a feasible time.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI220024 [doi]
AB  - Medical data science aims to facilitate knowledge discovery assisting in data, 
      algorithms, and results analysis. The FAIR principles aim to guide scientific 
      data management and stewardship, and are relevant to all digital health ecosystem 
      stakeholders. The FAIR4Health project aims to facilitate and encourage the health 
      research community to reuse datasets derived from publicly funded research 
      initiatives using the FAIR principles. The 'FAIRness for FHIR' project aims to 
      provide guidance on how HL7 FHIR could be utilized as a common data model to 
      support the health datasets FAIRification process. This first expected result is 
      an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) called FHIR4FAIR, covering how FHIR can be 
      used to cover FAIRification in different scenarios. This IG aims to provide 
      practical underpinnings for the FAIR4Health FAIRification workflow as a 
      domain-specific extension of the GoFAIR process, while simplifying curation, 
      advancing interoperability, and providing insights into a roadmap for health 
      datasets FAIR certification.

TI  - Data interchange using i2b2.
PG  - 909-15

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Reinventing data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) to 
      meet new analytical needs is slow and expensive. However, each new data research 
      network that wishes to support its own analytics tends to develop its own data 
      model. Joining these different networks without new data extraction, transform, 
      and load (ETL) processes can reduce the time and expense needed to participate. 
      The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project supports 
      data network interoperability through an ontology-driven approach. We use i2b2 as 
      a hub, to rapidly reconfigure data to meet new analytical requirements without 
      new ETL programming. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our 12-site National Patient-Centered 
      Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) uses 
      i2b2 to query data. We developed a process to generate a PCORnet Common Data 
      Model (CDM) physical database directly from existing i2b2 systems, thereby 
      supporting PCORnet analytic queries without new ETL programming. This involved: a 
      formalized process for representing i2b2 information models (the specification of 
      data types and formats); an information model that represents CDM Version 1.0; 
      and a program that generates CDM tables, driven by this information model. This 
      approach is generalizable to any logical information model. RESULTS: Eight 
      PCORnet CDRN sites have implemented this approach and generated a CDM database 
      without a new ETL process from the EHR. This enables federated querying within 
      the CDRN and compatibility with the national PCORnet Distributed Research 
      Network. DISCUSSION: We have established a way to adapt i2b2 to new information 
      models without requiring changes to the underlying data. Eight Scalable 
      Collaborative Infrastructure for a Learning Health System sites vetted this 
      methodology, resulting in a network that, at present, supports research on 10 
      million patients' data. CONCLUSION: New analytical requirements can be quickly 
      and cost-effectively supported by i2b2 without creating new data extraction 
      processes from the EHR.

PG  - 233-237
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190218 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents the extract-transform-and-load (ETL) process from the 
      Electronic Patient Records (ePR) at the Heart Institute (InCor) to the OMOP 
      Common Data Model (CDM) format. We describe the initial database 
      characterization, relational source mappings, selection filters, data 
      transformations and patient de-identification using the open-source OHDSI tools 
      and SQL scripts. We evaluate the resulting InCor-CDM database by recreating the 
      same patient cohort from a previous reference study (over the original data 
      source) and comparing the cohorts' descriptive statistics and inclusion reports. 
      The results exhibit that up to 91% of the reference patients were retrieved by 
      our method from the ePR through InCor-CDM, with AUC=0.938. The results indicate 
      that the method that we employed was able to produce a new database that was both 
      consistent with the original data and in accordance to the OMOP CDM standard.

TI  - FAIRifying a Quality Registry Using OMOP CDM: Challenges and Solutions.
PG  - 367-371
LID - 10.3233/SHTI220476 [doi]
AB  - The need for health data to be internationally Findable, Accessible, 
      Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) and thereby support integrative analysis with 
      other datasets has become crystal clear in the ongoing pandemic. The Dutch 
      National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) quality registry adopted the 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Database Model (OMOP CDM) to 
      achieve a FAIR database. In the process of adopting the OMOP CDM, many modeling, 
      technical, and communication challenges needed to be solved. Through 
      communication with the OMOP CDM implementation community, previously done 
      research and trial-and-error we found solutions that we believe can help other 
      healthcare institutions, especially ICU quality registries, FAIRify their 
      databases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) 
      supports observational and clinical research using health care data. The PCORnet 
      Antibiotics and Childhood Growth Study is one of PCORnet's inaugural 
      observational studies. We sought to describe the processes used to integrate and 
      analyze data from children across 35 participating institutions, the cohort 
      characteristics, and prevalence of antibiotic use. METHODS: We included children 
      in the cohort if they had at least one same-day height and weight measured in 
      each of 3 age periods: 1) before 12 months, 2) 12 to 30 months, and 3) after 24 
      months. We distributed statistical queries that each institution ran on its local 
      version of the PCORnet Common Data Model, with aggregate data returned for 
      analysis. We defined overweight or obesity as age- and sex-specific body mass 
      index ≥85th percentile, obesity ≥95th percentile, and severe obesity ≥120% of the 
      95th percentile. RESULTS: A total of 681,739 children met the cohort inclusion 
      criteria, and participants were racially/ethnically diverse (24.9% black, 17.5% 
      Hispanic). Before 24 months of age, 55.2% of children received at least one 
      antibiotic prescription; 21.3% received a single antibiotic prescription; 14.3% 
      received 4 or more; and 33.3% received a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Overweight 
      and obesity prevalence was 27.6% at age 4 to <6 years (n = 362,044) and 36.2% at 
      9 to <11 years (n = 58,344). CONCLUSIONS: The PCORnet Antibiotics and Childhood 
      Growth Study is a large national longitudinal observational study in a diverse 
      population that will examine the relationship between early antibiotic use and 
      subsequent growth patterns in children.

TI  - Mapping Local Biospecimen Records to the OMOP Common Data Model.
PG  - 422-429
AB  - Research to support precision medicine for leukemia patients requires integration 
      of biospecimen and clinical data. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      common data model (OMOP CDM) and its Specimen table presents a potential 
      solution. Although researchers have described progress and challenges in mapping 
      electronic health record (EHR) data to populate the OMOP CDM, to our knowledge no 
      studies have described populating the OMOP CDM with biospecimen data. Using 
      biobank data from our institution, we mapped 26% of biospecimen records to the 
      OMOP Specimen table. Records failed mapping due to local codes for time point 
      that were incompatible with the OMOP reference terminology. We recommend 
      expanding allowable codes to encompass research data, adding foreign keys to 
      leverage additional OMOP tables with data from other sources or to store 
      additional specimen details, and considering a new table to represent processed 
      samples and inventory.

AB  - We leveraged the largely untapped resource of electronic health record data to 
      address critical clinical and epidemiological questions about Coronavirus Disease 
      2019 (COVID-19). To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 
      hospitals across five countries (www.covidclinical.net). Contributors utilized 
      the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The 
      group focused on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data 
      were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis 
      and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 
      27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory 
      trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the 
      time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level 
      variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of 
      decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the 
      trajectory of COVID-19 disease in patients and their response to interventions.

AB  - HiGHmed is a German Consortium where eight University Hospitals have agreed to 
      the cross-institutional data exchange through novel medical informatics 
      solutions. The HiGHmed Use Case Infection Control group has modelled a set of 
      infection-related data in the openEHR format. In order to establish 
      interoperability with the other German Consortia belonging to the same national 
      initiative, we mapped the openEHR information to the Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format recommended within the initiative. FHIR 
      enables fast exchange of data thanks to the discrete and independent data 
      elements into which information is organized. Furthermore, to explore the 
      possibility of maximizing analysis capabilities for our data set, we subsequently 
      mapped the FHIR elements to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common 
      Data Model (OMOP CDM). The OMOP data model is designed to support the conduct of 
      research to identify and evaluate associations between interventions and outcomes 
      caused by these interventions. Mapping across standard allows to exploit their 
      peculiarities while establishing and/or maintaining interoperability. This 
      article provides an overview of our experience in mapping infection control 
      related data across three different standards openEHR, FHIR and OMOP CDM.

TI  - A Consensus-Based Approach for Harmonizing the OHDSI Common Data Model with HL7 
      FHIR.
PG  - 887-891
AB  - A variety of data models have been developed to provide a standardized data 
      interface that supports organizing clinical research data into a standard 
      structure for building the integrated data repositories. HL7 Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is emerging as a next generation standards 
      framework for facilitating health care and electronic health records-based data 
      exchange. The objective of the study was to design and assess a consensus-based 
      approach for harmonizing the OHDSI CDM with HL7 FHIR. We leverage a FHIR W5 (Who, 
      What, When, Where, and Why) Classification System for designing the harmonization 
      approaches and assess their utility in achieving the consensus among curators 
      using a standard inter-rater agreement measure. Moderate agreement was achieved 
      for the model-level harmonization (kappa = 0.50) whereas only fair agreement was 
      achieved for the property-level harmonization (kappa = 0.21). FHIR W5 is a useful 
      tool in designing the harmonization approaches between data models and FHIR, and 
      facilitating the consensus achievement.

TI  - Usability of OMOP Common Data Model for Detailed Lab Microbiology Results.
PG  - 292-296
LID - 10.3233/SHTI220461 [doi]
AB  - Anti-microbial resistance surveillance systems in Europe are limited by the 
      inability to link laboratory data and patient data. The OMOP Common Data Model 
      (OMOP CDM) is an option to store and use patient data in an international context 
      supporting observational research. Detailed medical microbiology laboratory data 
      are usually not stored in OMOP CDM. We propose here a solution to deal with the 
      inherent complexity of microbiology data and store those in the OMOP CDM v5.4. We 
      demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by capturing data from a microbiology 
      in vitro diagnostic middleware, modeling in OMOP CDM 5.4 and querying for 
      visualization.

TI  - MENDS-on-FHIR: Leveraging the OMOP common data model and FHIR standards for 
      national chronic disease surveillance.
LID - 2023.08.09.23293900 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293900 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Multi-State EHR-Based Network for Disease Surveillance (MENDS) is 
      a population-based chronic disease surveillance distributed data network that 
      uses institution-specific extraction-transformation-load (ETL) routines. 
      MENDS-on-FHIR examined using Health Language Seven's Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (HL7(®) FHIR(®)) and US Core Implementation Guide (US 
      Core IG) compliant resources derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to create a standards-based ETL 
      pipeline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input data source was a research data 
      warehouse containing clinical and administrative data in OMOP CDM Version 5.3 
      format. OMOP-to-FHIR transformations, using a unique JavaScript Object Notation 
      (JSON)-to-JSON transformation language called Whistle, created FHIR R4 V4.0.1/US 
      Core IG V4.0.0 conformant resources that were stored in a local FHIR server. A 
      REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request extracted FHIR resources to populate a local 
      MENDS database. RESULTS: Eleven OMOP tables were used to create 10 FHIR/US Core 
      compliant resource types. A total of 1.13 trillion resources were extracted and 
      inserted into the MENDS repository. A very low rate of non-compliant resources 
      was observed. DISCUSSION: OMOP-to-FHIR transformation results passed validation 
      with less than a 1% non-compliance rate. These standards-compliant FHIR resources 
      provided standardized data elements required by the MENDS surveillance use case. 
      The Bulk FHIR application programming interface (API) enabled population-level 
      data exchange using interoperable FHIR resources. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformation 
      pipeline creates a FHIR interface for accessing OMOP data. CONCLUSION: 
      MENDS-on-FHIR successfully replaced custom ETL with standards-based interoperable 
      FHIR resources using Bulk FHIR. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformations provide an 
      alternative mechanism for sharing OMOP data.

TI  - Considerations for Improving the Portability of Electronic Health Record-Based 
      Phenotype Algorithms.
PG  - 755-764
AB  - With the increased adoption of electronic health records, data collected for 
      routine clinical care is used for health outcomes and population sciences 
      research, including the identification of phenotypes. In recent years, research 
      networks, such as eMERGE, OHDSI and PCORnet, have been able to increase 
      statistical power and population diversity by combining patient cohorts. These 
      networks share phenotype algorithms that are executed at each participating site. 
      Here we observe experiences with phenotype algorithm portability across seven 
      research networks and propose a generalizable framework for phenotype algorithm 
      portability. Several strategies exist to increase the portability of phenotype 
      algorithms, reducing the implementation effort needed by each site. These include 
      using a common data model, standardized representation of the phenotype algorithm 
      logic, and technical solutions to facilitate federated execution of queries. 
      Portability is achieved by tradeoffs across three domains: Data, Authoring and 
      Implementation, and multiple approaches were observed in representing portable 
      phenotype algorithms. Our proposed framework will help guide future research in 
      operationalizing phenotype algorithm portability at scale.

TI  - Standardizing registry data to the OMOP Common Data Model: experience from three 
      pulmonary hypertension databases.
PG  - 238

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data 
      Model (CDM) can be used to transform observational health data to a common 
      format. CDM transformation allows for analysis across disparate databases for the 
      generation of new, real-word evidence, which is especially important in rare 
      disease where data are limited. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive, 
      life-threatening disease, with rare subgroups such as pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension (PAH), for which generating real-world evidence is challenging. Our 
      objective is to document the process and outcomes of transforming registry data 
      in PH to the OMOP CDM, and highlight challenges and our potential solutions. 
      METHODS: Three observational studies were transformed from the Clinical Data 
      Interchange Standards Consortium study data tabulation model (SDTM) to OMOP CDM 
      format. OPUS was a prospective, multi-centre registry (2014-2020) and OrPHeUS was 
      a retrospective, multi-centre chart review (2013-2017); both enrolled patients 
      newly treated with macitentan in the US. EXPOSURE is a prospective, multi-centre 
      cohort study (2017-ongoing) of patients newly treated with selexipag or any 
      PAH-specific therapy in Europe and Canada. OMOP CDM version 5.3.1 with recent 
      OMOP CDM vocabulary was used. Imputation rules were defined and applied for 
      missing dates to avoid exclusion of data. Custom target concepts were introduced 
      when existing concepts did not provide sufficient granularity. RESULTS: Of the 
      6622 patients in the three registry studies, records were mapped for 6457. Custom 
      target concepts were introduced for PAH subgroups (by combining SNOMED concepts 
      or creating custom concepts) and World Health Organization functional class. Per 
      the OMOP CDM convention, records about the absence of an event, or the lack of 
      information, were not mapped. Excluding these non-event records, 4% (OPUS), 2% 
      (OrPHeUS) and 1% (EXPOSURE) of records were not mapped. CONCLUSIONS: SDTM data 
      from three registries were transformed to the OMOP CDM with limited exclusion of 
      data and deviation from the SDTM database content. Future researchers can apply 
      our strategy and methods in different disease areas, with tailoring as necessary. 
      Mapping registry data to the OMOP CDM facilitates more efficient collaborations 
      between researchers and establishment of federated data networks, which is an 
      unmet need in rare diseases.

TI  - An OMOP-CDM based pharmacovigilance data-processing pipeline (PDP) providing 
      active surveillance for ADR signal detection from real-world data sources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are regarded as a major cause of death 
      and a major contributor to public health costs. For the active surveillance of 
      drug safety, the use of real-world data and real-world evidence as part of the 
      overall pharmacovigilance process is important. In this regard, many studies 
      apply the data-driven approaches to support pharmacovigilance. We developed a 
      pharmacovigilance data-processing pipeline (PDP) that utilized electronic health 
      records (EHR) and spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data to explore 
      pharmacovigilance signals. METHODS: To this end, we integrated two medical data 
      sources: Konyang University Hospital (KYUH) EHR and the United States Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). As part of the 
      presented PDP, we converted EHR data on the Observation Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) data model. To evaluate the ability of using the proposed PDP 
      for pharmacovigilance purposes, we performed a statistical validation using drugs 
      that induce ear disorders. RESULTS: To validate the presented PDP, we extracted 
      six drugs from the EHR that were significantly involved in ADRs causing ear 
      disorders: nortriptyline, (hazard ratio [HR] 8.06, 95% CI 2.41-26.91); 
      metoclopramide (HR 3.35, 95% CI 3.01-3.74); doxycycline (HR 1.73, 95% CI 
      1.14-2.62); digoxin (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08-2.38); acetaminophen (HR 1.59, 95% CI 
      1.47-1.72); and sucralfate (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06-1.38). In FAERS, the strongest 
      associations were found for nortriptyline (reporting odds ratio [ROR] 1.94, 95% 
      CI 1.73-2.16), sucralfate (ROR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.45), doxycycline (ROR 1.30, 
      95% CI 1.20-1.40), and hydroxyzine (ROR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29). We confirmed the 
      results in a meta-analysis using random and fixed models for doxycycline, 
      hydroxyzine, metoclopramide, nortriptyline, and sucralfate. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed PDP could support active surveillance and the strengthening of potential 
      ADR signals via real-world data sources. In addition, the PDP was able to 
      generate real-world evidence for drug safety.

AB  - Austria's national Electronic Health Record (EHR) system holds information on 
      medication prescriptions and dispenses in highly structured HL7 Clinical Document 
      Architecture (CDA) documents. Making these data accessible for research is

TI  - Towards the Representation of Genomic Data in HL7 FHIR and OMOP CDM.
PG  - 86-94
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210545 [doi]
AB  - High throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated an outburst in 
      biological knowledge over the past decades and thus enables improvements in 
      personalized medicine. In order to support (international) medical research with 
      the combination of genomic and clinical patient data, a standardization and 
      harmonization of these data sources is highly desirable. To support this 
      increasing importance of genomic data, we have created semantic mapping from raw 
      genomic data to both FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP 
      (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) CDM (Common Data Model) and analyzed 
      the data coverage of both models. For this, we calculated the mapping score for 
      different data categories and the relative data coverage in both FHIR and OMOP 
      CDM. Our results show, that the patients genomic data can be mapped to OMOP CDM 
      directly from VCF (Variant Call Format) file with a coverage of slightly over 
      50%. However, using FHIR as intermediate representation does not lead to further 
      information loss as the already stored data in FHIR can be further transformed 
      into OMOP CDM format with almost 100% success. Our findings are in favor of 
      extending OMOP CDM with patient genomic data using ETL to enable the researchers 
      to apply different analysis methods including machine learning algorithms on 
      genomic data.

TI  - German Claims Data for Real-World Research: Content Coverage Evaluation in OMOP 
      CDM.
PG  - 3-7
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230053 [doi]
AB  - Research on real-world data is becoming increasingly important. The current 
      restriction to clinical data in Germany limits the view of the patient. To gain 
      comprehensive insights, claims data can be added to the existing knowledge. 
      However, standardized transfer of German claims data into OMOP CDM is currently 
      not possible. In this paper, we conducted an evaluation regarding the coverage of 
      source vocabularies and data elements of German claims data in OMOP CDM. We point 
      out the need to extend vocabularies and mappings to support research on German 
      claims data.

TI  - Electronic health record data quality variability across a multistate clinical 
      research network.
PG  - e130
LID - 10.1017/cts.2023.548 [doi]
LID - e130
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) data have many quality problems that 
      may affect the outcome of research results and decision support systems. Many 
      methods have been used to evaluate EHR data quality. However, there has yet to be 
      a consensus on the best practice. We used a rule-based approach to assess the 
      variability of EHR data quality across multiple healthcare systems. METHODS: To 
      quantify data quality concerns across healthcare systems in a PCORnet Clinical 
      Research Network, we used a previously tested rule-based framework tailored to 
      the PCORnet Common Data Model to perform data quality assessment at 13 clinical 
      sites across eight states. Results were compared with the current PCORnet data 
      curation process to explore the differences between both methods. Additional 
      analyses of testosterone therapy prescribing were used to explore clinical care 
      variability and quality. RESULTS: The framework detected discrepancies across 
      sites, revealing evident data quality variability between sites. The detailed 
      requirements encoded the rules captured additional data errors with a specificity 
      that aids in remediation of technical errors compared to the current PCORnet data 
      curation process. Other rules designed to detect logical and clinical 
      inconsistencies may also support clinical care variability and quality programs. 
      CONCLUSION: Rule-based EHR data quality methods quantify significant 
      discrepancies across all sites. Medication and laboratory sources are causes of 
      data errors.

AB  - OMOP common data model (CDM) is designed for analyzing large clinical data and 
      building cohorts for medical research, which requires Extract-Transform-Load 
      processes (ETL) of local heterogeneous medical data. We present a concept for 
      developing and evaluating a modularized metadata-driven ETL process, which can 
      transform data into OMOP CDM regardless of 1) the source data format, 2) its 
      versions and 3) context of use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and public health problem, the 
      management of which will benefit from large-scale pragmatic research that 
      leverages electronic medical records (EMR). Requisite to using EMRs for HF 
      research is the development of reliable algorithms to identify HF patients. We 
      aimed to develop and validate computable phenotype algorithms to identify 
      patients with HF using standardized data elements defined by the Patient Centered 
      Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) Common Data Model (CDM). METHODS: We built HF 
      computable phenotypes utilizing the data domains of HF diagnosis codes, 
      prescribed HF-related medications and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide 
      (NT-proBNP). Algorithms were validated in a cohort (n = 76,254) drawn from 
      Olmsted County, MN between 2010-2012 a sample of whose records were manually 
      reviewed to confirm HF according to Framingham criteria. RESULTS: The different 
      algorithms we tested provided different tradeoffs between sensitivity and 
      positive predictive value (PPV). The highest sensitivity (78.7%) algorithm 
      utilized one HF diagnosis code and had the lowest PPV (68.5%). The addition of 
      more algorithm components, such as additional HF diagnosis codes, HF medications 
      or elevated NT-proBNP, improved the PPV while reducing sensitivity. When added to 
      a diagnostic code, the addition of NT-proBNP (>450 pg/mL) had a similar impact 
      compared to additional HF medication criteria, increasing PPV by ∼3-4% and 
      decreasing sensitivity by ∼7-10%. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithms derived from PCORnet 
      CDM elements can be used to identify patients with HF without manual adjudication 
      with reasonable sensitivity and PPV. Algorithm choice should be driven by the 
      goal of the research.

AB  - Observational research in cancer requires substantially more detail than most 
      other therapeutic areas. Cancer conditions are defined through histology, 
      affected anatomical structures, staging and grading, and biomarkers, and are 
      treated with complex therapies. Here, we show a new cancer module as part of the 
      OMOP CDM, allowing manual and automated abstraction and standardized analytics. 
      We tested the model in EHR and registry data against a number of typical use 
      cases.

TI  - Accessing OMOP Common Data Model Repositories with the i2b2 Webclient - Algorithm 
      for Automatic Query Translation.
PG  - 251-259
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210077 [doi]
AB  - In the era of translational research, data integration and clinical data 
      warehouses are important enabling technologies for clinical researchers. The OMOP 
      common data model is a wide-spread choice as a target for data integration in 
      medical informatics. It's portability of queries and analyses across different 
      institutions and data are ideal also from the viewpoint of the FAIR principles. 
      Yet, the OMOP CDM lacks a simple and intuitive user interface for untrained users 
      to run simple queries for feasibility analysis. Aim of this study is to provide 
      an algorithm to translate any given i2b2 query to an equivalent query which can 
      then be run on the OMOP CDM database. The provided algorithm is able to convert 
      queries created in the i2b2 webclient to SQL statements which can be executed on 
      a standard OMOP CDM database programmatically.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To gain insight into the real-life care of patients in the healthcare 
      system, data from hospital information systems and insurance systems are 
      required. Consequently, linking clinical data with claims data is necessary. To 
      ensure their syntactic and semantic interoperability, the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) from the Observational Health 
      Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community was chosen. However, there is no 
      detailed guide that would allow researchers to follow a generic process for data 
      harmonization, i.e. the transformation of local source data into the standardized 
      OMOP CDM format. Thus, the aim of this paper is to conceptualize a generic data 
      harmonization process for OMOP CDM. METHODS: For this purpose, we conducted a 
      literature review focusing on publications that address the harmonization of 
      clinical or claims data in OMOP CDM. Subsequently, the process steps used and 
      their chronological order as well as applied OHDSI tools were extracted for each 
      included publication. The results were then compared to derive a generic sequence 
      of the process steps. RESULTS: From 23 publications included, a generic data 
      harmonization process for OMOP CDM was conceptualized, consisting of nine process 
      steps: dataset specification, data profiling, vocabulary identification, coverage 
      analysis of vocabularies, semantic mapping, structural mapping, 
      extract-transform-load-process, qualitative and quantitative data quality 
      analysis. Furthermore, we identified seven OHDSI tools which supported five of 
      the process steps. CONCLUSIONS: The generic data harmonization process can be 
      used as a step-by-step guide to assist other researchers in harmonizing source 
      data in OMOP CDM.

PG  - 54-59
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230011 [doi]
AB  - The Austrian nationwide EHR system ELGA can contribute valuable data for research 
      due to its high volume of data and broad population coverage. In order to be 
      applicable in international research projects, transformation to a standardized, 
      research-oriented data model such as the OMOP common data model is essential. In 
      this paper we describe our experience with the corresponding transformation task. 
      Using Python scripts, we implemented a prototypical process that extracts, 
      transforms, maps, and loads fully structured sections of ELGA documents to an

AB  - Information Technology (IT) and specialized systems could have a prominent role 
      towards the support of drug safety processes, both in the clinical context but 
      also beyond that. PVClinical project aims to build an IT platform, enabling the 
      investigation of potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). In this paper, we 
      outline the utilization of Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership - Common 
      Data Model (OMOP-CDM) and the openly available Observational Health Data Sciences 
      and Informatics (OHDSI) software stack as part of PVClinical platform. OMOP-CDM 
      offers the capacity to integrate data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) 
      (e.g., encounters, patients, providers, diagnoses, drugs, measurements and 
      procedures) via an accepted data model. Furthermore, the OHDSI software stack 
      provides valuable analytics tools which could be used to address important 
      questions regarding drug safety quickly and efficiently, enabling the 
      investigation of potential ADRs in the clinical environment.

TI  - FHIR-Ontop-OMOP: Building clinical knowledge graphs in FHIR RDF with the OMOP 
      Common data Model.
PG  - 104201
LID - S1532-0464(22)00206-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104201 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a key role to enable explainable 
      artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare. Constructing clinical 
      knowledge graphs (CKGs) against heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) 
      has been desired by the research and healthcare AI communities. From the 
      standardization perspective, community-based standards such as the Fast 
      Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) are increasingly used to 
      represent and standardize EHR data for clinical data analytics, however, the 
      potential of such a standard on building CKG has not been well investigated. 
      OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate methods and tools that expose the OMOP 
      CDM-based clinical data repositories into virtual clinical KGs that are compliant 
      with FHIR Resource Description Framework (RDF) specification. METHODS: We 
      developed a system called FHIR-Ontop-OMOP to generate virtual clinical KGs from 
      the OMOP relational databases. We leveraged an OMOP CDM-based Medical Information 
      Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data repository to evaluate the 
      FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system in terms of the faithfulness of data transformation and 
      the conformance of the generated CKGs to the FHIR RDF specification. RESULTS: A 
      beta version of the system has been released. A total of more than 100 data 
      element mappings from 11 OMOP CDM clinical data, health system and vocabulary 
      tables were implemented in the system, covering 11 FHIR resources. The generated 
      virtual CKG from MIMIC-III contains 46,520 instances of FHIR Patient, 716,595 
      instances of Condition, 1,063,525 instances of Procedure, 24,934,751 instances of 
      MedicationStatement, 365,181,104 instances of Observations, and 4,779,672 
      instances of CodeableConcept. Patient counts identified by five pairs of SQL 
      (over the MIMIC database) and SPARQL (over the virtual CKG) queries were 
      identical, ensuring the faithfulness of the data transformation. Generated CKG in 
      RDF triples for 100 patients were fully conformant with the FHIR RDF 
      specification. CONCLUSION: The FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system can expose OMOP database as 
      a FHIR-compliant RDF graph. It provides a meaningful use case demonstrating the 
      potentials that can be enabled by the interoperability between FHIR and OMOP CDM. 
      Generated clinical KGs in FHIR RDF provide a semantic foundation to enable 
      explainable AI applications in healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, Electronic Health Records (EHR) are 
      increasingly being converted to Common Data Models (CDMs), a database schema 
      designed to provide standardized vocabularies to facilitate collaborative 
      observational research. To date, however, rare attempts exist to leverage CDM 
      data for healthcare process mining, a technique to derive process-related 
      knowledge (e.g., process model) from event logs. This paper presents a method to 
      extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM for process mining and demonstrates CDM-based 
      healthcare process mining with several real-life study cases while answering 
      frequently posed questions in process mining, in the CDM environment. METHODS: We 
      propose a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the OMOP CDM 
      for process types including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room processes, and 
      patient journey. Using the proposed method, we extract the retrospective data of 
      several surgical procedure cases (i.e., Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH), 
      Total Hip Replacement (THR), Coronary Bypass (CB), Transcatheter Aortic Valve 
      Implantation (TAVI), Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD)) from the CDM of a Korean 
      tertiary hospital. Patient data are extracted for each of the operations and 
      analyzed using several process mining techniques. RESULTS: Using process mining, 
      the clinical pathways, outpatient process models, emergency room process models, 
      and patient journeys are demonstrated using the extracted logs. The result shows 
      CDM's usability as a novel and valuable data source for healthcare process 
      analysis, yet with a few considerations. We found that CDM should be complemented 
      by different internal and external data sources to address the administrative and 
      operational aspects of healthcare processes, particularly for outpatient and ER 
      process analyses. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to 
      exploit CDM for healthcare process mining. Specifically, we provide a 
      step-by-step guidance by demonstrating process analysis from locating relevant 
      CDM tables to visualizing results using process mining tools. The proposed method 
      can be widely applicable across different institutions. This work can contribute 
      to bringing a process mining perspective to the existing CDM users in the 
      changing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) environment and also to facilitating 
      CDM-based studies in the process mining research community.

LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementing clinical phenotypes across a network is labor intensive 
      and potentially error prone. Use of a common data model may facilitate the 
      process. METHODS: Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) sites 
      implemented the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model across their 
      electronic health record (EHR)-linked DNA biobanks. Two previously implemented 
      eMERGE phenotypes were converted to OMOP and implemented across the network. 
      RESULTS: It was feasible to implement the common data model across sites, with 
      laboratory data producing the greatest challenge due to local encoding. Sites 
      were then able to execute the OMOP phenotype in less than one day, as opposed to 
      weeks of effort to manually implement an eMERGE phenotype in their bespoke 
      research EHR databases. Of the sites that could compare the current OMOP 
      phenotype implementation with the original eMERGE phenotype implementation, 
      specific agreement ranged from 100% to 43%, with disagreements due to the 
      original phenotype, the OMOP phenotype, changes in data, and issues in the 
      databases. Using the OMOP query as a standard comparison revealed differences in 
      the original implementations despite starting from the same definitions, code 
      lists, flowcharts, and pseudocode. CONCLUSION: Using a common data model can 
      dramatically speed phenotype implementation at the cost of having to populate 
      that data model, though this will produce a net benefit as the number of 
      phenotype implementations increases. Inconsistencies among the implementations of 
      the original queries point to a potential benefit of using a common data model so 
      that actual phenotype code and logic can be shared, mitigating human error in 
      reinterpretation of a narrative phenotype definition.

TI  - European Health Data & Evidence Network-learnings from building out a 
      standardized international health data network.
PG  - 209-219
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocad214 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health data standardized to a common data model (CDM) simplifies and 
      facilitates research. This study examines the factors that make standardizing 
      observational health data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      (OMOP) CDM successful. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five data partners (DPs) 
      from 11 countries received funding from the European Health Data Evidence Network 
      (EHDEN) to standardize their data. Three surveys, DataQualityDashboard results, 
      and statistics from the conversion process were analyzed qualitatively and 
      quantitatively. Our measures of success were the total number of days to 
      transform source data into the OMOP CDM and participation in network research. 
      RESULTS: The health data converted to CDM represented more than 133 million 
      patients. 100%, 88%, and 84% of DPs took Surveys 1, 2, and 3. The median duration 
      of the 6 key extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes ranged from 4 to 
      115 days. Of the 25 DPs, 21 DPs were considered applicable for analysis of which 
      52% standardized their data on time, and 48% participated in an international 
      collaborative study. DISCUSSION: This study shows that the consistent workflow 
      used by EHDEN proves appropriate to support the successful standardization of 
      observational data across Europe. Over the 25 successful transformations, we 
      confirmed that getting the right people for the ETL is critical and vocabulary 
      mapping requires specific expertise and support of tools. Additionally, we 
      learned that teams that proactively prepared for data governance issues were able 
      to avoid considerable delays improving their ability to finish on time. 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides guidance for future DPs to standardize to the 
      OMOP CDM and participate in distributed networks. We demonstrate that the 
      Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics community must continue to 
      evaluate and provide guidance and support for what ultimately develops the 
      backbone of how community members generate evidence.

PG  - 322-326
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230127 [doi]
AB  - The amount of research on the gathering and handling of healthcare data keeps 
      growing. To support multi-center research, numerous institutions have sought to 
      create a common data model (CDM). However, data quality issues continue to be a 
      major obstacle in the development of CDM. To address these limitations, a data 
      quality assessment system was created based on the representative data model OMOP 
      CDM v5.3.1. Additionally, 2,433 advanced evaluation rules were created and 
      incorporated into the system by mapping the rules of existing OMOP CDM quality 
      assessment systems. The data quality of six hospitals was verified using the 
      developed system and an overall error rate of 0.197% was confirmed. Finally, we 
      proposed a plan for high-quality data generation and the evaluation of 
      multi-center CDM quality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to transform a resource of linked electronic 
      health records (EHR) to the OMOP common data model (CDM) and evaluate the process 
      in terms of syntactic and semantic consistency and quality when implementing 
      disease and risk factor phenotyping algorithms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 
      heart failure (HF) as an exemplar, we represented three national EHR sources 
      (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted 
      Patient Care, Office for National Statistics) into the OMOP CDM 5.2. We compared 
      the original and CDM HF patient population by calculating and presenting 
      descriptive statistics of demographics, related comorbidities, and relevant 
      clinical biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 502 536 patients with the 
      incident and prevalent HF and converted 1 099 195 384 rows of data from 216 581 
      914 encounters across three EHR sources to the OMOP CDM. The largest percentage 
      (65%) of unmapped events was related to medication prescriptions in primary care. 
      The average coverage of source vocabularies was >98% with the exception of 
      laboratory tests recorded in primary care. The raw and transformed data were 
      similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities with the largest difference 
      observed being 3.78% in the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can successfully be 
      applied to convert EHR linked across multiple healthcare settings and represent 
      phenotyping algorithms spanning multiple sources. Similar to previous research, 
      challenges mapping primary care prescriptions and laboratory measurements still 
      persist and require further work. The use of OMOP CDM in national UK EHR is a 
      valuable research tool that can enable large-scale reproducible observational 
      research.

TI  - Standardizing electronic health record ventilation data in the pediatric 
      long-term mechanical ventilator-dependent population.
PG  - 433-440
LID - 10.1002/ppul.26204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sharing data across institutions is critical to improving care for 
      children who are using long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV). Mechanical 
      ventilation data are complex and poorly standardized. This lack of data 
      standardization is a major barrier to data sharing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to 
      describe current ventilator data in the electronic health record (EHR) and 
      propose a framework for standardizing these data using a common data model (CDM) 
      across multiple populations and sites. METHODS: We focused on a cohort of 
      patients with LTMV dependence who were weaned from mechanical ventilation (MV). 
      We extracted and described relevant EHR ventilation data. We identified the 
      minimum necessary components, termed "Clinical Ideas," to describe MV from time 
      of initiation to liberation. We then utilized existing resources and partnered 
      with informatics collaborators to develop a framework for incorporating Clinical 
      Ideas into the PEDSnet CDM based on the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP). RESULTS: We identified 78 children with LTMV dependence who 
      weaned from ventilator support. There were 25 unique device names and 28 unique 
      ventilation mode names used in the cohort. We identified multiple Clinical Ideas 
      necessary to describe ventilator support over time: device, interface, 
      ventilation mode, settings, measurements, and duration of ventilation usage per 
      day. We used Concepts from the SNOMED-CT vocabulary and integrated an existing 
      ventilator mode taxonomy to create a framework for CDM and OMOP integration. 
      CONCLUSION: The proposed framework standardizes mechanical ventilation 
      terminology and may facilitate efficient data exchange in a multisite network. 
      Rapid data sharing is necessary to improve research and clinical care for 
      children with LTMV dependence.

AB  - PURPOSE: The US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Innovation Center aimed 
      to establish a query-ready, quality-checked distributed data network containing 
      electronic health records (EHRs) linked with insurance claims data for at least 
      10 million individuals to expand the utility of real-world data for regulatory 
      decision-making. METHODS: In this report, we describe the resulting network, the 
      Real-World Evidence Data Enterprise (RWE-DE), including data from two commercial 
      EHR-claims linked assets collectively termed the Commercial Network covering 21 
      million lives, and four academic partner institutions collectively termed the 
      Development Network covering 4.5 million lives. RESULTS: We discuss provenance 
      and completeness of the data converted in the Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM), 
      describe patient populations, and report on EHR-claims linkage characterization 
      for all contributing data sources. Further, we introduce a standardized process 
      to store free-text notes in the Development Network for efficient retrieval as 
      needed. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we outline typical use cases for the RWE-DE where 
      it can broaden the reach of the types of questions that can be addressed by the 
      Sentinel system.

TI  - The Preserving Kidney Function in Children With CKD (PRESERVE) Study: Rationale, 
      Design, and Methods.
PG  - 100722
LID - 10.1016/j.xkme.2023.100722 [doi]
LID - 100722
AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: PRESERVE seeks to provide new knowledge to inform shared 
      decision-making regarding blood pressure (BP) management for pediatric chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). PRESERVE will compare the effectiveness of alternative 
      strategies for monitoring and treating hypertension on preserving kidney 
      function; expand the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network 
      (PCORnet) common data model by adding pediatric- and kidney-specific variables 
      and linking electronic health record data to other kidney disease databases; and 
      assess the lived experiences of patients related to BP management. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Multicenter retrospective cohort study (clinical outcomes) and cross-sectional 
      study (patient-reported outcomes [PROs]). SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: PRESERVE will 
      include approximately 20,000 children between January 2009-December 2022 with 
      mild-moderate CKD from 15 health care institutions that participate in 6 PCORnet 
      Clinical Research Networks (PEDSnet, STAR, GPC, PaTH, CAPRiCORN, and 
      OneFlorida+). The inclusion criteria were ≥1 nephrologist visit and ≥2 estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values in the range of 30 
      to <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) separated by ≥90 days without an intervening 
      value ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and no prior dialysis or kidney transplant. EXPOSURES: 
      BP measurements (clinic-based and 24-hour ambulatory BP); urine protein; and 
      antihypertensive treatment by therapeutic class. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is 
      a composite event of a 50% reduction in eGFR, eGFR of <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 
      long-term dialysis or kidney transplant. Secondary outcomes include change in 
      eGFR, adverse events, and PROs. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Longitudinal models for 
      dichotomous (proportional hazards or accelerated failure time) and continuous 
      (generalized linear mixed models) clinical outcomes; multivariable linear 
      regression for PROs. We will evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effect by CKD 
      etiology and degree of proteinuria and will examine variation in hypertension 
      management and outcomes based on socio-demographics. LIMITATIONS: Causal 
      inference limited by observational analyses. CONCLUSIONS: PRESERVE will leverage 
      the PCORnet infrastructure to conduct large-scale observational studies that 
      address BP management knowledge gaps for pediatric CKD, focusing on outcomes that 
      are meaningful to patients. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Hypertension is a major 
      modifiable contributor to loss of kidney function in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). The purpose of PRESERVE is to provide evidence to inform shared 
      decision-making regarding blood pressure management for children with CKD. 
      PRESERVE is a consortium of 16 health care institutions in PCORnet, the National 
      Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, and includes electronic health record 
      data for >19,000 children with CKD. PRESERVE will (1) expand the PCORnet 
      infrastructure for research in pediatric CKD by adding kidney-specific variables 
      and linking electronic health record data to other kidney disease databases; (2) 
      compare the effectiveness of alternative strategies for monitoring and treating 
      hypertension on preserving kidney function; and (3) assess the lived experiences 
      of patients and caregivers related to blood pressure management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health systems spend $1.5 billion annually reporting data on 
      quality, but efficacy and utility for benchmarking are limited due, in part, to 
      limitations of data sources. Our objective was to implement and evaluate measures 
      of pediatric quality for three conditions using electronic health record 
      (EHR)-derived data. METHODS: PCORnet networks standardized EHR-derived data to a 
      common data model. In 13 health systems from 2 networks for 2015, we implemented 
      the National Quality Forum measures: % children with sickle cell anemia who 
      received a transcranial Doppler; % children on antipsychotics who had metabolic 
      screening; and % pediatric acute otitis media with amoxicillin prescribed. Manual 
      chart review assessed measure accuracy. RESULTS: Only 39% (N = 2,923) of 7,278 
      children on antipsychotics received metabolic screening (range: 20%-54%). If the 
      measure indicated screening was performed, the chart agreed 88% of the time [95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 81%-94%]; if it indicated screening was not done, the 
      chart agreed 86% (95% CI: 78%-93%). Only 69% (N = 793) of 1,144 children received 
      transcranial Doppler screening (range across sites: 49%-88%). If the measure 
      indicated screening was performed, the chart agreed 98% of the time (95% CI: 
      94%-100%); if it indicated screening was not performed, the chart agreed 89% (95% 
      CI: 82%-95%). For acute otitis media, chart review identified many qualifying 
      cases missed by the National Quality Forum measure, which excluded a common 
      diagnostic code. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of healthcare quality developed using 
      EHR-derived data were valid and identified wide variation among network sites. 
      This data can facilitate the identification and spread of best practices.

TI  - ROMOP: a light-weight R package for interfacing with OMOP-formatted electronic 
      health record data.
PG  - 10-14
LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooy059 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Electronic health record (EHR) data are increasingly used for 
      biomedical discoveries. The nature of the data, however, requires expertise in 
      both data science and EHR structure. The Observational Medical Out-comes 
      Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) standardizes the language and 
      structure of EHR data to promote interoperability of EHR data for research. While 
      the OMOP CDM is valuable and more attuned to research purposes, it still requires 
      extensive domain knowledge to utilize effectively, potentially limiting more 
      widespread adoption of EHR data for research and quality improvement. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We have created ROMOP: an R package for direct interfacing with EHR 
      data in the OMOP CDM format. RESULTS: ROMOP streamlines typical EHR-related data 
      processes. Its functions include exploration of data types, extraction and 
      summarization of patient clinical and demographic data, and patient searches 
      using any CDM vocabulary concept. CONCLUSION: ROMOP is freely available under the 
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license and can be obtained from 
      GitHub (http://github.com/BenGlicksberg/ROMOP). We detail instructions for setup 
      and use in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we provide a public sandbox 
      server containing synthesized clinical data for users to explore OMOP data and 
      ROMOP (http://romop.ucsf.edu).

TI  - Towards an Electronic Health Prevention Record Based on HL7 FHIR and the OMOP 
      Common Data Model.
PG  - 107-112
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 40% of all recorded deaths in Austria are due to 
      behavioral risks. These risks could be avoided with appropriate measures. 
      OBJECTIVES: Extension of the concept of EHR and EMR to an electronic prevention 
      record, focusing on primary and secondary prevention. METHODS: The concept of a 
      structured prevention pathway, based on the principles of P4 Medicine, was 
      developed for a multidisciplinary prevention network. An IT infrastructure based 
      on HL7 FHIR and the OHDSI OMOP common data model was designed. RESULTS: An IT 
      solution supporting a structured and modular prevention pathway was 
      conceptualized. It contained a personalized management of prevention, risk 
      assessment, diagnostic and preventive measures supported by a modular, 
      interoperable IT infrastructure including a health app, prevention record 
      web-service, decision support modules and a smart prevention registry, separating 
      primary and secondary use of data. CONCLUSION: A concept was created on how an 
      electronic health prevention record based on HL7 FHIR and the OMOP common data 
      model can be implemented.

TI  - Transformation of Electronic Health Records and Questionnaire Data to OMOP CDM: A 
      Feasibility Study Using SG_T2DM Dataset.
PG  - 757-767
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1732301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important public health concern in 
      Singapore and places a massive burden on health care spending. Tackling chronic 
      diseases such as DM requires innovative strategies to integrate patients' data 
      from diverse sources and use scientific discovery to inform clinical practice 
      that can help better manage the disease. The Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) was chosen as the framework for 
      integrating data with disparate formats. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate 
      the feasibility of converting Singapore based data source, comprising of 
      electronic health records (EHR), cognitive and depression assessment 
      questionnaire data to OMOP CDM standard. Additionally, we also validate whether 
      our OMOP CDM instance is fit for the purpose of research by executing a simple 
      treatment pathways study using Atlas, a graphical user interface tool to conduct 
      analysis on OMOP CDM data as a proof of concept. METHODS: We used de-identified 
      EHR, cognitive, and depression assessment questionnaires data from a tertiary 
      care hospital in Singapore to convert it to version 5.3.1 of OMOP CDM standard. 
      We evaluate the OMOP CDM conversion by (1) assessing the mapping coverage (that 
      is the percentage of source terms mapped to OMOP CDM standard); (2) local raw 
      dataset versus CDM dataset analysis; and (3) Implementing Harmonized Intrinsic 
      Data Quality Framework using an open-source R package called Data Quality 
      Dashboard. RESULTS: The content coverage of OMOP CDM vocabularies is more than 
      90% for clinical data, but only around 11% for questionnaire data. The comparison 
      of characteristics between source and target data returned consistent results and 
      our transformed data did not pass 38 (1.4%) out of 2,622 quality checks. 
      CONCLUSION: Adoption of OMOP CDM at our site demonstrated that EHR data are 
      feasible for standardization with minimal information loss, whereas challenges 
      remain for standardizing cognitive and depression assessment questionnaire data 
      that requires further work.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an emerging interest in the use of claims and 
      electronic health record (EHR) data for evaluation of medical device safety and 
      effectiveness. In Korea, national insurance electronic data interchange (EDI) 
      code has been used as a medical device data source for common data model (CDM). 
      This study performed a preliminary feasibility assessment of CDM-based vigilance. 
      A cross-sectional study of target medical device data in EHR and CDM was 
      conducted. A total of 155 medical devices were finally enrolled, with 58.7% of 
      them having EDI codes. Femoral head prosthesis was selected as a focus group. It 
      was registered in our institute with 11 EDI codes. However, only three EDI codes 
      were converted to systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms concept. 
      EDI code was matched in one-to-many (up to 104) with unique device identifier 
      (UDI), including devices classified as different global medical device 
      nomenclature. The use of UDI rather than EDI code as a medical device data source 
      is recommended. We hope that this study will share the current state of medical 
      device data recorded in the EHR and contribute to the introduction of CDM-based 
      medical device vigilance by selecting appropriate medical device data sources.

AB  - Researchers often use prescribing data from electronic health records (EHR) or 
      dispensing data from medication or medical claims to determine medication 
      utilization. However, neither source has complete information on medication use. 
      We compared antibiotic prescribing and dispensing records for 200,395 patients in 
      the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Antibiotics and 
      Childhood Growth Study. We stratified analyses by delivery system type [closed 
      integrated (cIDS) and non-cIDS]; 90.5 percent and 39.4 percent of prescribing 
      records had matching dispensing records, and 92.7 percent and 64.0 percent of 
      dispensing records had matching prescribing records at cIDS and non-cIDS, 
      respectively. Most of the dispensings without a matching prescription did not 
      have same-day encounters in the EHR, suggesting they were medications given 
      outside the institution providing data, such as those from urgent care or retail 
      clinics. The sensitivity of prescriptions in the EHR, using dispensings as a gold 
      standard, was 99.1 percent and 89.9 percent for cIDS and non-cIDS, respectively. 
      Only 0.7 percent and 6.1 percent of patients at cIDS and non-cIDS, respectively, 
      were classified as false-negative, i.e. entirely unexposed to antibiotics when 
      they in fact had dispensings. These patients were more likely to have a complex 
      chronic condition or asthma. Overall, prescription records worked well to 
      identify exposure to antibiotics. EHR data, such as the data available in 
      PCORnet, is a unique and vital resource for clinical research. Closing data gaps 
      by understanding why prescriptions may not be captured can improve this type of 
      data, making it more robust for observational research.

AB  - Cultivated by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet), thirteen 
      regional clinical data research networks (CDRNs) are taking shape across the U.S. 
      The PCORnet common data model was carefully planned, and the data marts assembled 
      by the more than 80 data-contributing institutions (nodes) are undergoing, in 
      2016-2017, a series of data characterization cycles. PCORnet will adjudge each 
      node's-and thereby, in a significant way, each CDRN's-readiness or unreadiness 
      for multi-institution research. Certifying each node's quality and fidelity is of 
      course essential. But in understanding network readiness there is an additional, 
      vital dimension-one that has received too little attention. It is the development 
      of knowledge about the nature of a CDRN's data, in its federated sense. With 
      visualizations, how might one grasp the meta-data of a CDRN? We outline an 
      approach that builds upon the HealthLNK Data Repository, a forerunner to the 
      Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN) CDRN.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate common data models (CDMs) to determine which is best 
      suited for sharing data from a large, longitudinal, electronic health record 
      (EHR)-based community registry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four CDMs were chosen from 
      models in use for clinical research data: Sentinel v5.0 (referred to as the 
      Mini-Sentinel CDM in previous versions), PCORnet v3.0 (an extension of the 
      Mini-Sentinel CDM), OMOP v5.0, and CDISC SDTM v1.4. Each model was evaluated 
      against 11 criteria adapted from previous research. The criteria fell into six 
      categories: content coverage, integrity, flexibility, ease of querying, standards 
      compatibility, and ease and extent of implementation. RESULTS: The OMOP CDM 
      accommodated the highest percentage of our data elements (76%), fared well on 
      other requirements, and had broader terminology coverage than the other models. 
      Sentinel and PCORnet fell short in content coverage with 37% and 48% matches 
      respectively. Although SDTM accommodated a significant percentage of data 
      elements (55% true matches), 45% of the data elements mapped to SDTM's extension 
      mechanism, known as Supplemental Qualifiers, increasing the number of joins 
      required to query the data. CONCLUSION: The OMOP CDM best met the criteria for 
      supporting data sharing from longitudinal EHR-based studies. Conclusions may 
      differ for other uses and associated data element sets, but the methodology 
      reported here is easily adaptable to common data model evaluation for other uses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We present the Clinical Trial Knowledge Base, a regularly updated 
      knowledge base of discrete clinical trial eligibility criteria equipped with a 
      web-based user interface for querying and aggregate analysis of common 
      eligibility criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a natural language 
      processing (NLP) tool named Criteria2Query (Yuan et al., 2019) to transform free 
      text clinical trial eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov into discrete 
      criteria concepts and attributes encoded using the widely adopted Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and stored in a 
      relational SQL database. A web application accessible via RESTful APIs was 
      implemented to enable queries and visual aggregate analyses. We demonstrate 
      CTKB's potential role in EHR phenotype knowledge engineering using ten validated 
      phenotyping algorithms. RESULTS: At the time of writing, CTKB contained 87,504 
      distinctive OMOP CDM standard concepts, including Condition (47.82%), Drug 
      (23.01%), Procedure (13.73%), Measurement (24.70%) and Observation (5.28%), with 
      34.78% for inclusion criteria and 65.22% for exclusion criteria, extracted from 
      352,110 clinical trials. The average hit rate of criteria concepts in eMERGE 
      phenotype algorithms is 77.56%. CONCLUSION: CTKB is a novel comprehensive 
      knowledge base of discrete eligibility criteria concepts with the potential to 
      enable knowledge engineering for clinical trial cohort definition, clinical trial 
      population representativeness assessment, electronical phenotyping, and data gap 
      analyses for using electronic health records to support clinical trial 
      recruitment.

AB  - Deficiencies in data sharing capabilities limit Social Determinants of Health 
      (SDoH) analysis as part of COVID-19 research. The National COVID Cohort 
      Collaborative (N3C) is an example of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) database 
      of patients tested for COVID-19 that could benefit from a SDoH elements framework 
      that captures various screening instruments in EHR data warehouse systems. This 
      paper uses the University of Washington Enterprise Data Warehouse (a data 
      contributor to N3C) to demonstrate how SDoH can be represented and managed to be 
      made available within an OMOP common data model. We found that these data varied 
      by type of social determinants data and where it was collected, in the time 
      period that it was collected, and in how it was represented.

TI  - A comparison of active adverse event surveillance systems worldwide.
PG  - 581-96
LID - 10.1007/s40264-014-0194-3 [doi]
AB  - Post-marketing drug surveillance for adverse drug events (ADEs) has typically 
      relied on spontaneous reporting. Recently, regulatory agencies have turned their 
      attention to more preemptive approaches that use existing data for surveillance. 
      We conducted an environmental scan to identify active surveillance systems 
      worldwide that use existing data for the detection of ADEs. We extracted data 
      about the systems' structures, data, and functions. We synthesized the 
      information across systems to identify common features of these systems. We 
      identified nine active surveillance systems. Two systems are US based-the FDA 
      Sentinel Initiative (including both the Mini-Sentinel Initiative and the Federal 
      Partner Collaboration) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD); two are 
      Canadian-the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES) and 
      the Vaccine and Immunization Surveillance in Ontario (VISION); and two are 
      European-the Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions by Integrative 
      Mining of Clinical Records and Biomedical Knowledge (EU-ADR) Alliance and the 
      Vaccine Adverse Event Surveillance and Communication (VAESCO). Additionally, 
      there is the Asian Pharmacoepidemiology Network (AsPEN) and the Shanghai Drug 
      Monitoring and Evaluative System (SDMES). We identified two systems in the UK-the 
      Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines (VRMM) Division and the Drug Safety 
      Research Unit (DSRU), an independent academic unit. These surveillance systems 
      mostly use administrative claims or electronic medical records; most conduct 
      pharmacovigilance on behalf of a regulatory agency. Either a common data model or 
      a centralized model is used to access existing data. The systems have been built 
      using national data alone or via partnership with other countries. However, 
      active surveillance systems using existing data remain rare. North America and 
      Europe have the most population coverage; with Asian countries making good 
      advances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use of electronic data capture (EDC) systems for 
      research and electronic health records (EHR), most transfer of data between EHR 
      and EDC systems is manual and error prone. Increased adoption of Health Level 
      Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) application programming 
      interfaces (APIs) in recent years by EHR systems has increased the availability 
      of patient data for external applications such as REDCap. OBJECTIVE: Describe the 
      development of the REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) module 
      that provides seamless data exchange between the REDCap research EDC and any EHR 
      system with a FHIR API. CDIS enables end users to independently set up their data 
      collection projects, map EHR data to fields, and adjudicate data transfer without 
      project-by-project involvement from Health Information Technology staff. METHODS: 
      We identified two use cases for EHR data transfer into REDCap. Clinical Data Pull 
      (CDP) automatically pulls EHR data into user-defined REDCap fields and replaces 
      the workflow of having to transcribe or copy and paste data from the EHR. 
      Clinical Data Mart (CDM) collects all specified data for a patient over a given 
      time period and replaces the process of importing EHR data for registries from 
      research databases. With an iterative process, we designed our access control, 
      authentication, variable selection, and mapping interfaces in such a way that end 
      users could easily set up and use CDIS. RESULTS: Since its release, the REDCap 
      CDIS has been used to pull over 19.5 million data points for 82 projects at 
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Software and documentation are available 
      through the REDCap Consortium. CONCLUSIONS: The new REDCap Clinical Data and 
      Interoperability Services (CDIS) module leverages the FHIR standard to enable 
      real-time and direct data extraction from the EHR. Researchers can self-service 
      the mapping and adjudication of EHR data into REDCap. The uptake of CDIS at VUMC 
      and other REDCap consortium sites is improving the accuracy and efficiency of EHR 
      data collection by reducing the need for manual transcription and flat file 
      uploads.

TI  - An Interoperable Similarity-based Cohort Identification Method Using the OMOP 
      Common Data Model version 5.0.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1007/s41666-017-0005-6 [doi]
AB  - Cohort identification for clinical studies tends to be laborious, time-consuming, 
      and expensive. Developing automated or semi-automated methods for cohort 
      identification is one of the "holy grails" in the field of biomedical 
      informatics. We propose a high-throughput similarity-based cohort identification 
      algorithm by applying numerical abstractions on Electronic Health Records (EHR) 
      data. We implement this algorithm using the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), which enables sites using this 
      standardized EHR data representation to avail this algorithm with minimum effort 
      for local implementation. We validate its performance for a retrospective cohort 
      identification task on six clinical trials conducted at the Columbia University 
      Medical Center. Our algorithm achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 
      0.966 and an average Precision at 5 of 0.983. This interoperable method promises 
      to achieve efficient cohort identification in EHR databases. We discuss suitable 
      applications of our method and its limitations and propose warranted future work.

TI  - Transforming Anesthesia Data Into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      Common Data Model: Development and Usability Study.
PG  - e29259
LID - 10.2196/29259 [doi]
LID - e29259
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs, such as those created by an 
      anesthesia management system) generate a large amount of data that can notably be 
      reused for clinical audits and scientific research. The sharing of these data and 
      tools is generally affected by the lack of system interoperability. To overcome 
      these issues, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) 
      developed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model 
      (CDM) to standardize EHR data and promote large-scale observational and 
      longitudinal research. Anesthesia data have not previously been mapped into the 
      OMOP CDM. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to transform anesthesia data into 
      the OMOP CDM. The secondary objective was to provide vocabularies, queries, and 
      dashboards that might promote the exploitation and sharing of anesthesia data 
      through the CDM. METHODS: Using our local anesthesia data warehouse, a group of 5 
      experts from 5 different medical centers identified local concepts related to 
      anesthesia. The concepts were then matched with standard concepts in the OHDSI 
      vocabularies. We performed structural mapping between the design of our local 
      anesthesia data warehouse and the OMOP CDM tables and fields. To validate the 
      implementation of anesthesia data into the OMOP CDM, we developed a set of 
      queries and dashboards. RESULTS: We identified 522 concepts related to anesthesia 
      care. They were classified as demographics, units, measurements, operating room 
      steps, drugs, periods of interest, and features. After semantic mapping, 353 
      (67.7%) of these anesthesia concepts were mapped to OHDSI concepts. Further, 169 
      (32.3%) concepts related to periods and features were added to the OHDSI 
      vocabularies. Then, 8 OMOP CDM tables were implemented with anesthesia data and 2 
      new tables (EPISODE and FEATURE) were added to store secondarily computed data. 
      We integrated data from 5,72,609 operations and provided the code for a set of 8 
      queries and 4 dashboards related to anesthesia care. CONCLUSIONS: Generic data 
      concerning demographics, drugs, units, measurements, and operating room steps 
      were already available in OHDSI vocabularies. However, most of the intraoperative 
      concepts (the duration of specific steps, an episode of hypotension, etc) were 
      not present in OHDSI vocabularies. The OMOP mapping provided here enables 
      anesthesia data reuse.

TI  - MENDS-on-FHIR: leveraging the OMOP common data model and FHIR standards for 
      national chronic disease surveillance.
PG  - ooae045
LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae045 [doi]
LID - ooae045
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Multi-State EHR-Based Network for Disease Surveillance (MENDS) is 
      a population-based chronic disease surveillance distributed data network that 
      uses institution-specific extraction-transformation-load (ETL) routines. 
      MENDS-on-FHIR examined using Health Language Seven's Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (HL7(®) FHIR(®)) and US Core Implementation Guide (US 
      Core IG) compliant resources derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to create a standards-based ETL 
      pipeline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input data source was a research data 
      warehouse containing clinical and administrative data in OMOP CDM Version 5.3 
      format. OMOP-to-FHIR transformations, using a unique JavaScript Object Notation 
      (JSON)-to-JSON transformation language called Whistle, created FHIR R4 V4.0.1/US 
      Core IG V4.0.0 conformant resources that were stored in a local FHIR server. A 
      REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request extracted FHIR resources to populate a local 
      MENDS database. RESULTS: Eleven OMOP tables were used to create 10 FHIR/US Core 
      compliant resource types. A total of 1.13 trillion resources were extracted and 
      inserted into the MENDS repository. A very low rate of non-compliant resources 
      was observed. DISCUSSION: OMOP-to-FHIR transformation results passed validation 
      with less than a 1% non-compliance rate. These standards-compliant FHIR resources 
      provided standardized data elements required by the MENDS surveillance use case. 
      The Bulk FHIR application programming interface (API) enabled population-level 
      data exchange using interoperable FHIR resources. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformation 
      pipeline creates a FHIR interface for accessing OMOP data. CONCLUSION: 
      MENDS-on-FHIR successfully replaced custom ETL with standards-based interoperable 
      FHIR resources using Bulk FHIR. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformations provide an 
      alternative mechanism for sharing OMOP data.

TI  - Developing an ETL tool for converting the PCORnet CDM into the OMOP CDM to 
      facilitate the COVID-19 data integration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The large-scale collection of observational data and digital 
      technologies could help curb the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the coexistence of 
      multiple Common Data Models (CDMs) and the lack of data extract, transform, and 
      load (ETL) tool between different CDMs causes potential interoperability issue 
      between different data systems. The objective of this study is to design, 
      develop, and evaluate an ETL tool that transforms the PCORnet CDM format data 
      into the OMOP CDM. METHODS: We developed an open-source ETL tool to facilitate 
      the data conversion from the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. The ETL tool was 
      evaluated using a dataset with 1000 patients randomly selected from the PCORnet 
      CDM at Mayo Clinic. Information loss, data mapping accuracy, and gap analysis 
      approaches were conducted to assess the performance of the ETL tool. We designed 
      an experiment to conduct a real-world COVID-19 surveillance task to assess the 
      feasibility of the ETL tool. We also assessed the capacity of the ETL tool for 
      the COVID-19 data surveillance using data collection criteria of the MN EHR 
      Consortium COVID-19 project. RESULTS: After the ETL process, all the records of 
      1000 patients from 18 PCORnet CDM tables were successfully transformed into 12 
      OMOP CDM tables. The information loss for all the concept mapping was less than 
      0.61%. The string mapping process for the unit concepts lost 2.84% records. 
      Almost all the fields in the manual mapping process achieved 0% information loss, 
      except the specialty concept mapping. Moreover, the mapping accuracy for all the 
      fields were 100%. The COVID-19 surveillance task collected almost the same set of 
      cases (99.3% overlaps) from the original PCORnet CDM and target OMOP CDM 
      separately. Finally, all the data elements for MN EHR Consortium COVID-19 project 
      could be captured from both the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. CONCLUSION: We 
      demonstrated that our ETL tool could satisfy the data conversion requirements 
      between the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. The outcome of the work would 
      facilitate the data retrieval, communication, sharing, and analysis between 
      different institutions for not only COVID-19 related project, but also other 
      real-world evidence-based observational studies.

AB  - The MIRACUM consortium is developing a Clinical Trials Recruitment Support System 
      to support the data-driven recruitment of patients for clinical trials. The 
      design of the prototype includes both open source solutions (OMOP CDM, Atlas) and 
      open standards for interoperability (FHIR). The aim of the prototype is to create 
      a patient screening list of potential participants for a clinical study. The 
      paper shows the modular structure and functionality of the prototype building the 
      foundation for the practical implementation of the CTRSS and, at the same time, 
      demonstrating the use of open source solutions and standards for the development 
      of clinical support systems.

PG  - 587-595
AB  - Linking Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores to observational data offers the 
      opportunity to characterize healthcare treatment and outcomes that are driven by 
      socioeconomic deprivation. The current study aims to assess the feasibility of 
      creating an analysis package to link ADI rankings to multiple patient-level EHR 
      datasets transformed into the OMOP CDM. Patients within two cancer cohorts 
      (breast cancer and multiple myeloma) were identified within two OMOP datasets and 
      their records were linked with ADI scores using address information in the OMOP 
      location table. With ADI linked to patient addresses, we generated visualizations 
      showing the geographic distribution of each cohort based on ADI scores. 
      Additionally, further assessment showed that over 89% of patient addresses could 
      successfully be linked with ADI rankings. In conducting this assessment, we have 
      demonstrated that developing a package to link ADI scores with multiple OMOP 
      datasets is feasible.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI240674 [doi]
AB  - Real-world data (RWD) (i.e., data from Electronic Healthcare Records - EHRs, 
      ePrescription systems, patient registries, etc.) gain increasing attention as 
      they could support observational studies on a large scale. OHDSI is one of the 
      most prominent initiatives regarding the harmonization of RWD and the development 
      of relevant tools via the use of a common data model, OMOP-CDM. OMOP-CDM is a 
      crucial step towards syntactic and semantic data interoperability. Still, 
      OMOP-CDM is based on a typical relational database format, and thus, the vision 
      of a fully connected semantically enriched model is not fully realized. This work 
      presents an open-source effort to map the OMOP-CDM model and the data it hosts, 
      to an ontological model using RDF to support the FAIRness of RWD and their 
      interlinking with Linked Open Data (LOD) towards the vision of the Semantic Web.

      Data Set.
PG  - 272-276
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230117 [doi]
AB  - The German Medical Informatics Initiative makes clinical routine data available 
      for biomedical research. In total, 37 university hospitals have set up so-called 
      data integration centers to facilitate this data reuse. A standardized set of HL7 
      FHIR profiles ("MII Core Data Set") defines the common data model across all 
      centers. Regular Projectathons ensure continuous evaluation of the implemented 
      data sharing processes on artificial and real-world clinical use cases. In this 
      context, FHIR continues to rise in popularity for exchanging patient care data. 
      As reusing data from patient care in clinical research requires high trust in the 
      data, data quality assessments are a key point of concern in the data sharing 
      process. To support the setup of data quality assessments within data integration 
      centers, we suggest a process for finding elements of interest from FHIR 
      profiles. We focus on the specific data quality measures defined by Kahn et al.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Electronic health record (EHR) data have emerged as an important 
      resource for population health and clinical research. There have been significant 
      efforts to leverage EHR data for research; however, given data security concerns 
      and the complexity of the data, EHR data are frequently difficult to access and 
      use for clinical studies. We describe the development of a Clinical Research 
      Datamart (CRDM) that was developed to provide well-curated and easily accessible 
      EHR data to Duke University investigators. METHODS: The CRDM was designed to (1) 
      contain most of the patient-level data elements needed for research studies; (2) 
      be directly accessible by individuals conducting statistical analyses (including 
      Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) core members); (3) be 
      queried via a code-based system to promote reproducibility and consistency across 
      studies; and (4) utilize a secure protected analytic workspace in which sensitive 
      EHR data can be stored and analyzed. The CRDM utilizes data transformed for the 
      PCORnet data network, and was augmented with additional data tables containing 
      site-specific data elements to provide additional contextual information. 
      RESULTS: We provide descriptions of ideal use cases and discuss dissemination and 
      evaluation methods, including future work to expand the user base and track the 
      use and impact of this data resource. CONCLUSIONS: The CRDM utilizes resources 
      developed as part of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) 
      program and could be replicated by other institutions with CTSAs.

AB  - The increasing use of electronic health records (EHRs) in veterinary medicine 
      creates an opportunity to utilize the high volume of electronic patient data for 
      mining and data-driven analytics with the goal of improving patient care and 
      outcomes. A central focus of the Clinical and Translational Science Award One 
      Health Alliance (COHA) is to integrate efforts across multiple disciplines to 
      better understand shared diseases in animals and people. The ability to combine 
      veterinary and human medical data provides a unique resource to study the 
      interactions and relationships between animals, humans, and the environment. 
      However, to effectively answer these questions, veterinary EHR data must first be 
      prepared in the same way it is now commonly being done in human medicine to 
      enable data mining and development of analytics to facilitate knowledge formation 
      and solutions that advance our understanding of disease processes, with the 
      ultimate goal of improving outcomes for veterinary patients and their owners. As 
      a first step, COHA member institutions implemented a Common Data Model to 
      standardize EHR data. Herein we present the approach executed within the COHA 
      framework to prepare and optimize veterinary EHRs for data mining and knowledge 
      formation based on the adoption of the Observational Health Data Sciences and 
      Informatics' Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model.

TI  - Transforming electronic health record polysomnographic data into the 
      Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's Common Data Model: a pilot 
      feasibility study.

AB  - Well-defined large-volume polysomnographic (PSG) data can identify subgroups and 
      predict outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, current PSG data are 
      scattered across numerous sleep laboratories and have different formats in the 
      electronic health record (EHR). Hence, this study aimed to convert EHR PSG into a 
      standardized data format-the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) 
      common data model (CDM). We extracted the PSG data of a university hospital for 
      the period from 2004 to 2019. We designed and implemented an 
      extract-transform-load (ETL) process to transform PSG data into the OMOP CDM 
      format and verified the data quality through expert evaluation. We converted the 
      data of 11,797 sleep studies into CDM and added 632,841 measurements and 9,535 
      observations to the existing CDM database. Among 86 PSG parameters, 20 were 
      mapped to CDM standard vocabulary and 66 could not be mapped; thus, new custom 
      standard concepts were created. We validated the conversion and usefulness of PSG 
      data through patient-level prediction analyses for the CDM data. We believe that 
      this study represents the first CDM conversion of PSG. In the future, CDM 
      transformation will enable network research in sleep medicine and will contribute 
      to presenting more relevant clinical evidence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the reusable transformation process of electronic health 
      records (EHR), claims, and prescriptions data into Observational Medical Outcome 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), together with challenges faced and 
      solutions implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used Estonian national health 
      databases that store almost all residents' claims, prescriptions, and EHR 
      records. To develop and demonstrate the transformation process of Estonian health 
      data to OMOP CDM, we used a 10% random sample of the Estonian population 
      (n = 150 824 patients) from 2012 to 2019 (MAITT dataset). For the sample, 
      complete information from all 3 databases was converted to OMOP CDM version 5.3. 
      The validation was performed using open-source tools. RESULTS: In total, we 
      transformed over 100 million entries to standard concepts using standard OMOP 
      vocabularies with the average mapping rate 95%. For conditions, observations, 
      drugs, and measurements, the mapping rate was over 90%. In most cases, SNOMED 
      Clinical Terms were used as the target vocabulary. DISCUSSION: During the 
      transformation process, we encountered several challenges, which are described in 
      detail with concrete examples and solutions. CONCLUSION: For a representative 10% 
      random sample, we successfully transferred complete records from 3 national 
      health databases to OMOP CDM and created a reusable transformation process. Our 
      work helps future researchers to transform linked databases into OMOP CDM more 
      efficiently, ultimately leading to better real-world evidence.

TI  - Validating a Computable Phenotype for Nephrotic Syndrome in Children and Adults 
      Using PCORnet Data.
PG  - 1979-1986
LID - 10.34067/KID.0002892021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary nephrotic syndromes are rare diseases which can impede 
      adequate sample size for observational patient-oriented research and clinical 
      trial enrollment. A computable phenotype may be powerful in identifying patients 
      with these diseases for research across multiple institutions. METHODS: A 
      comprehensive algorithm of inclusion and exclusion ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to 
      identify patients with primary nephrotic syndrome was developed. The algorithm 
      was executed against the PCORnet CDM at three institutions from January 1, 2009 
      to January 1, 2018, where a random selection of 50 cases and 50 noncases 
      (individuals not meeting case criteria seen within the same calendar year and 
      within 5 years of age of a case) were reviewed by a nephrologist, for a total of 
      150 cases and 150 noncases reviewed. The classification accuracy (sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive and negative predictive value, F1 score) of the computable 
      phenotype was determined. RESULTS: The algorithm identified a total of 2708 
      patients with nephrotic syndrome from 4,305,092 distinct patients in the CDM at 
      all sites from 2009 to 2018. For all sites, the sensitivity, specificity, and 
      area under the curve of the algorithm were 99% (95% CI, 97% to 99%), 79% (95% CI, 
      74% to 85%), and 0.9 (0.84 to 0.97), respectively. The most common causes of 
      false positive classification were secondary FSGS (nine out of 39) and lupus 
      nephritis (nine out of 39). CONCLUSION: This computable phenotype had good 
      classification in identifying both children and adults with primary nephrotic 
      syndrome utilizing only ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, which are available across 
      institutions in the United States. This may facilitate future screening and 
      enrollment for research studies and enable comparative effectiveness research. 
      Further refinements to the algorithm including use of laboratory data or addition 
      of natural language processing may help better distinguish primary and secondary 
      causes of nephrotic syndrome.

TI  - Clinical Predictive Modeling Development and Deployment through FHIR Web 
      Services.
PG  - 717-26
AB  - Clinical predictive modeling involves two challenging tasks: model development 
      and model deployment. In this paper we demonstrate a software architecture for 
      developing and deploying clinical predictive models using web services via the 
      Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. 
      The services enable model development using electronic health records (EHRs) 
      stored in OMOP CDM databases and model deployment for scoring individual patients 
      through FHIR resources. The MIMIC2 ICU dataset and a synthetic outpatient dataset 
      were transformed into OMOP CDM databases for predictive model development. The 
      resulting predictive models are deployed as FHIR resources, which receive 
      requests of patient information, perform prediction against the deployed 
      predictive model and respond with prediction scores. To assess the practicality 
      of this approach we evaluated the response and prediction time of the FHIR 
      modeling web services. We found the system to be reasonably fast with one second 
      total response time per patient prediction.

TI  - Fidelity assessment of a clinical practice research datalink conversion to the 
      OMOP common data model.
PG  - 945-59
LID - 10.1007/s40264-014-0214-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The unique structure and coding of the Clinical Practice Research 
      Datalink (CPRD) presents challenges for epidemiologic analysis and for 
      comparisons with other databases. To address this limitation we sought to 
      transform CPRD into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common 
      Data Model (CDM). METHODS: An extraction, transformation and loading process was 
      developed, which detailed source code mappings, Read code domain classification, 
      an imputation algorithm for drug duration and special handling of 
      lifestyle/clinical data. Completeness and accuracy of the above elements were 
      assessed. A final validation exercise involved replication of a published 
      case-control study that examined use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs) and the risk of first-time acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in raw CPRD 
      data and the CPRD CDM. FINDINGS: All elements of the CPRD CDM transformation were 
      assessed to be of high quality. 99.9 % of database condition records and 89.7 % 
      of database drug records were mapped (majority unmapped drugs were devices and 
      over-the-counter products); 3.1 % of duration imputations were deemed possibly 
      erroneous and prevalences for selected conditions and drugs across CPRD raw and 
      CDM data were equivalent. Results between the replication raw data and CDM study 
      agreed for conditions, demographics and lifestyle data with slight NSAID exposure 
      data loss owing to unmapped drugs. CONCLUSION: CPRD can be accurately transformed 
      into the OMOP CDM with acceptable information loss across drugs, conditions and 
      observations. We determined that for a particular use, case CDM structure was 
      adequate and mappings could be improved but did not substantially change the 
      results of our analysis.

      (OMOP-CDM) Electronic Health Records to an OWL Ontology.
PG  - 76-80
LID - 10.3233/SHTI220035 [doi]
AB  - The heterogeneity of electronic health records model is a major problem: it is 
      necessary to gather data from various models for clinical research, but also for 
      clinical decision support. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership - 
      Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) has emerged as a standard model for structuring 
      health records populated from various other sources. This model is proposed as a 
      relational database schema. However, in the field of decision support, formal 
      ontologies are commonly used. In this paper, we propose a translation of OMOP-CDM 
      into an ontology, and we explore the utility of the semantic web for structuring 
      EHR in a clinical decision support perspective, and the use of the SPARQL 
      language for querying health records. The resulting ontology is available online.

TI  - Electronic clinical laboratory test results data tables: lessons from 
      Mini-Sentinel.
PG  - 609-18
LID - 10.1002/pds.3580 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Developing electronic clinical data into a common data model posed 
      substantial challenges unique from those encountered with administrative data. We 
      present here the design, implementation, and use of the Mini-Sentinel Distributed 
      Database laboratory results table (LRT). METHODS: We developed the LRT and guided 
      Mini-Sentinel data partners (DPs) in populating it from their source data. Data 
      sources included electronic health records and internal and contracted clinical 
      laboratory systems databases. We employed the Logical Observation Identifiers, 
      Names, and Codes (LOINC®) results reporting standards. We evaluated transformed 
      results data using data checks and an iterative, ongoing characterization and 
      harmonization process. RESULTS: Key LRT variables included test name, 
      subcategory, specimen source, LOINC, patient location, specimen date and time, 
      result unit, and unique person identifier. Selected blood and urine chemistry, 
      hematology, coagulation, and influenza tests were included. Twelve DPs with 
      outpatient test results participated; four also contributed inpatient test 
      results. As of September 2013, the LRT included 385,516,239 laboratory test 
      results; data are refreshed at least quarterly. LOINC availability and use varied 
      across DP. Multiple data quality and content issues were identified and 
      addressed. CONCLUSION: Developing the LRT brought together disparate data sources 
      with no common coding structure. Clinical laboratory test results obtained during 
      routine healthcare delivery are neither uniformly coded nor documented in a 
      standardized manner. Applying a systematic approach with data harmonization 
      efforts and ongoing oversight and management is necessary for a clinical 
      laboratory results data table to remain valid and useful.

AB  - Common data models standardize the structures and semantics of health datasets, 
      enabling reproducibility and large-scale studies that leverage the data from 
      multiple locations and settings. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is one of the leading common data models. While 
      there is a strong incentive to convert datasets to OMOP, the conversion is time 
      and resource-intensive, leaving the research community in need of tools for 
      mapping data to OMOP. We propose an extract, transform, load (ETL) framework that 
      is metadata-driven and generic across source datasets. The ETL framework uses a 
      new data manipulation language (DML) that organizes SQL snippets in YAML. Our 
      framework includes a compiler that converts YAML files with mapping logic into an 
      ETL script. Access to the ETL framework is available via a web application, 
      allowing users to upload and edit YAML files via web editor and obtain an ETL SQL 
      script for use in development environments. The structure of the DML maximizes 
      readability, refactoring, and maintainability, while minimizing technical debt 
      and standardizing the writing of ETL operations for mapping to OMOP. Our 
      framework also supports transparency of the mapping process and reuse by 
      different institutions.

TI  - Evaluation of OMOP CDM, i2b2 and ICGC ARGO for supporting data harmonization in a 
      breast cancer use case of a multicentric European AI project.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Observational research in cancer poses great challenges regarding 
      adequate data sharing and consolidation based on a homogeneous data semantic 
      base. Common Data Models (CDMs) can help consolidate health data repositories 
      from different institutions minimizing loss of meaning by organizing data into a 
      standard structure. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, Informatics for 
      Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) and International Cancer Genome 
      Consortium, Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology (ICGC ARGO) for 
      representing non-imaging data in a breast cancer use case of EuCanImage. METHODS: 
      We used ontologies to represent metamodels of OMOP, i2b2, and ICGC ARGO and 
      variables used in a cancer use case of a European AI project. We selected four 
      evaluation criteria for the CDMs adapted from previous research: content 
      coverage, simplicity, integration, implementability. RESULTS: i2b2 and OMOP 
      exhibited higher element completeness (100% each) than ICGC ARGO (58.1%), while 
      the three achieved 100% domain completeness. ICGC ARGO normalizes only one of our 
      variables with a standard terminology, while i2b2 and OMOP use standardized 
      vocabularies for all of them. In terms of simplicity, ICGC ARGO and i2b2 proved 
      to be simpler both in terms of ontological model (276 and 175 elements, 
      respectively) and in the queries (7 and 20 lines of code, respectively), while 
      OMOP required a much more complex ontological model (615 elements) and queries 
      similar to those of i2b2 (20 lines). Regarding implementability, OMOP had the 
      highest number of mentions in articles in PubMed (130) and Google Scholar 
      (1,810), ICGC ARGO had the highest number of updates to the CDM since 2020 (4), 
      and i2b2 is the model with more tools specifically developed for the CDM (26). 
      CONCLUSION: ICGC ARGO proved to be rigid and very limited in the representation 
      of oncologic concepts, while i2b2 and OMOP showed a very good performance. i2b2's 
      lack of a common dictionary hinders its scalability, requiring sites that will 
      share data to explicitly define a conceptual framework, and suggesting that OMOP 
      and its Oncology extension could be the more suitable choice. Future research 
      employing these CDMs with actual datasets is needed.

AB  - Building an integrated data model that includes not only clinical data but also 
      personal health records has become increasingly important. We aimed to build a 
      big data healthcare platform by developing a common data model that can be 
      utilized in the healthcare field. To this end, we acquired health data from 
      various communities to establish community care digital healthcare service 
      models. Further, to improve personal health data interoperability, we ensured 
      conformance to international standards, namely, the Systemized Nomenclature of 
      Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) and transmission standards, namely, Health 
      Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (HL7 FHIR). Furthermore, FHIR 
      resource profiling was designed to transmit and receive data, following the HL7 
      FHIR R4 guidelines.

TI  - Eos and OMOCL: Towards a seamless integration of openEHR records into the OMOP 
      Common Data Model.
PG  - 104437

AB  - BACKGROUND: The reuse of data from electronic health records (EHRs) for research 
      purposes promises to improve the data foundation for clinical trials and may even 
      support to enable them. Nevertheless, EHRs are characterized by both, 
      heterogeneous structure and semantics. To standardize this data for research, the 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) 
      standard has recently seen an increase in use. However, the conversion of these 
      EHRs into the OMOP CDM requires complex and resource intensive Extract Transform 
      and Load (ETL) processes. This hampers the reuse of clinical data for research. 
      To solve the issues of heterogeneity of EHRs and the lack of semantic precision 
      on the care site, the openEHR standard has recently seen wider adoption. A 
      standardized process to integrate openEHR records into the CDM potentially lowers 
      the barriers of making EHRs accessible for research. Yet, a comprehensive 
      approach about the integration of openEHR records into the OMOP CDM has not yet 
      been made. METHODS: We analyzed both standards and compared their models to 
      identify possible mappings. Based on this, we defined the necessary processes to 
      transform openEHR records into CDM tables. We also discuss the limitation of 
      openEHR with its unspecific demographics model and propose two possible 
      solutions. RESULTS: We developed the OMOP Conversion Language (OMOCL) which 
      enabled us to define a declarative openEHR archetype-to-CDM mapping language. 
      Using OMOCL, it was possible to define a set of mappings. As a proof-of-concept, 
      we implemented the Eos tool, which uses the OMOCL-files to successfully 
      automatize the ETL from real-world and sample EHRs into the OMOP CDM. DISCUSSION: 
      Both Eos and OMOCL provide a way to define generic mappings for an integration of 
      openEHR records into OMOP. Thus, it represents a significant step towards 
      achieving interoperability between the clinical and the research data domains. 
      However, the transformation of openEHR data into the less expressive OMOP CDM 
      leads to a loss of semantics.

AB  - Clinical data repositories often use entity-attribute-value (EAV) data models. To 
      be valuable for secondary use, these health data can be transformed to the 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The 
      present paper describes the lessons learned from such an endeavour based on the 
      concept of registering transformation functions on source data elements. We

AB  - There are many initiatives attempting to harmonize data collection across human 
      clinical studies using common data elements (CDEs). The increased use of CDEs in 
      large prior studies can guide researchers planning new studies. For that purpose, 
      we analyzed the All of Us (AoU) program, an ongoing US study intending to enroll 
      one million participants and serve as a platform for numerous observational 
      analyses. AoU adopted the OMOP Common Data Model to standardize both research 
      (Case Report Form [CRF]) and real-world (imported from Electronic Health Records 
      [EHRs]) data. AoU standardized specific data elements and values by including 
      CDEs from terminologies such as LOINC and SNOMED CT. For this study, we defined 
      all elements from established terminologies as CDEs and all custom concepts 
      created in the Participant Provided Information (PPI) terminology as unique data 
      elements (UDEs). We found 1 033 research elements, 4 592 element-value 
      combinations and 932 distinct values. Most elements were UDEs (869, 84.1%), while 
      most CDEs were from LOINC (103 elements, 10.0%) or SNOMED CT (60, 5.8%). Of the 
      LOINC CDEs, 87 (53.1% of 164 CDEs) originated from previous data collection 
      initiatives, such as PhenX (17 CDEs) and PROMIS (15 CDEs). On a CRF level, The 
      Basics (12 of 21 elements, 57.1%) and Lifestyle (10 of 14, 71.4%) were the only 
      CRFs with multiple CDEs. On a value level, 61.7% of distinct values are from an 
      established terminology. AoU demonstrates the use of the OMOP model for 
      integrating research and routine healthcare data (64 elements in both contexts), 
      which allows for monitoring lifestyle and health changes outside the research 
      setting. The increased inclusion of CDEs in large studies (like AoU) is important 
      in facilitating the use of existing tools and improving the ease of understanding 
      and analyzing the data collected, which is more challenging when using study 
      specific formats.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transparency and traceability are essential for establishing 
      trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). The lack of transparency in the data 
      preparation process is a significant obstacle in developing reliable AI systems 
      which can lead to issues related to reproducibility, debugging AI models, bias 
      and fairness, and compliance and regulation. We introduce a formal data 
      preparation pipeline specification to improve upon the manual and error-prone 
      data extraction processes used in AI and data analytics applications, with a 
      focus on traceability. METHODS: We propose a declarative language to define the 
      extraction of AI-ready datasets from health data adhering to a common data model, 
      particularly those conforming to HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources 
      (FHIR). We utilize the FHIR profiling to develop a common data model tailored to 
      an AI use case to enable the explicit declaration of the needed information such 
      as phenotype and AI feature definitions. In our pipeline model, we convert 
      complex, high-dimensional electronic health records data represented with 
      irregular time series sampling to a flat structure by defining a target 
      population, feature groups and final datasets. Our design considers the 
      requirements of various AI use cases from different projects which lead to 
      implementation of many feature types exhibiting intricate temporal relations. 
      RESULTS: We implement a scalable and high-performant feature repository to 
      execute the data preparation pipeline definitions. This software not only ensures 
      reliable, fault-tolerant distributed processing to produce AI-ready datasets and 
      their metadata including many statistics alongside, but also serve as a pluggable 
      component of a decision support application based on a trained AI model during 
      online prediction to automatically prepare feature values of individual entities. 
      We deployed and tested the proposed methodology and the implementation in three 
      different research projects. We present the developed FHIR profiles as a common 
      data model, feature group definitions and feature definitions within a data 
      preparation pipeline while training an AI model for "predicting complications 
      after cardiac surgeries". DISCUSSION: Through the implementation across various 
      pilot use cases, it has been demonstrated that our framework possesses the 
      necessary breadth and flexibility to define a diverse array of features, each 
      tailored to specific temporal and contextual criteria.

TI  - Converting OMOP CDM to phenopackets: A model alignment and patient data 
      representation evaluation.
PG  - 104659
LID - S1532-0464(24)00077-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2024.104659 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to promote interoperability in precision medicine and 
      translational research by aligning the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      (OMOP) and Phenopackets data models. Phenopackets is an expert knowledge-driven 
      schema designed to facilitate the storage and exchange of multimodal patient 
      data, and support downstream analysis. The first goal of this paper is to explore 
      model alignment by characterizing the common data models using a newly developed 
      data transformation process and evaluation method. Second, using OMOP normalized 
      clinical data, we evaluate the mapping of real-world patient data to 
      Phenopackets. We evaluate the suitability of Phenopackets as a patient data 
      representation for real-world clinical cases. METHODS: We identified mappings 
      between OMOP and Phenopackets and applied them to a real patient dataset to 
      assess the transformation's success. We analyzed gaps between the models and 
      identified key considerations for transforming data between them. Further, to 
      improve ambiguous alignment, we incorporated Unified Medical Language System 
      (UMLS) semantic type-based filtering to direct individual concepts to their most 
      appropriate domain and conducted a domain-expert evaluation of the mapping's 
      clinical utility. RESULTS: The OMOP to Phenopacket transformation pipeline was 
      executed for 1,000 Alzheimer's disease patients and successfully mapped all 
      required entities. However, due to missing values in OMOP for required 
      Phenopacket attributes, 10.2 % of records were lost. The use of UMLS-semantic 
      type filtering for ambiguous alignment of individual concepts resulted in 96 % 
      agreement with clinical thinking, increased from 68 % when mapping exclusively by 
      domain correspondence. CONCLUSION: This study presents a pipeline to transform 
      data from OMOP to Phenopackets. We identified considerations for the 
      transformation to ensure data quality, handling restrictions for successful 
      Phenopacket validation and discrepant data formats. We identified unmappable 
      Phenopacket attributes that focus on specialty use cases, such as genomics or 
      oncology, which OMOP does not currently support. We introduce UMLS semantic type 
      filtering to resolve ambiguous alignment to Phenopacket entities to be most 
      appropriate for real-world interpretation. We provide a systematic approach to 
      align OMOP and Phenopackets schemas. Our work facilitates future use of 
      Phenopackets in clinical applications by addressing key barriers to 
      interoperability when deriving a Phenopacket from real-world patient data.

      Collections or Hospital Information Systems into HL7 FHIR Bundles.
PG  - 75-79
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210053 [doi]
AB  - Data integration is a necessary and important step to perform translational 
      research and improve the sample size beyond single data collections. For health 
      information, the most recent established communication standards is HL7 FHIR. To 
      bridge the concepts of "minimal invasive" data integration and open standards, we 
      propose a generic ETL framework to process arbitrary patient related data 
      collections into HL7 FHIR - which in turn can then be used for loading into 
      target data warehouses. The proposed algorithm is able to read any relational 
      delimited text exports and produce a standard HL7 FHIR bundle collection. We 
      evaluated an implementation of the algorithm using different lung research 
      registries and used the resulting FHIR resources to fill our i2b2 based data 
      warehouse as well an OMOP common data model repository.

      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. OMOP is one of 
      several standard data models presently used in national-scale initiatives. Each 
      model is unique enough to make interoperability difficult. The i2b2 data 
      warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which 
      uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously 
      demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform 
      data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously 
      implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) 
      network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network 
      model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 
      high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because 
      the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to 
      Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we 
      leveraged sites' existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed 
      an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP 
      concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU 
      New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset 
      in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant 
      with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data 
      warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the 
      transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected 
      shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP's visual Achilles data 
      quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO 
      production data to AOU. It is open-source and ready for use by other research 
      projects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain detailed clinical data 
      stored in proprietary formats with non-standard codes and structures. 
      Participating in multi-site clinical research networks requires EHR data to be 
      restructured and transformed into a common format and standard terminologies, and 
      optimally linked to other data sources. The expertise and scalable solutions 
      needed to transform data to conform to network requirements are beyond the scope 
      of many health care organizations and there is a need for practical tools that 
      lower the barriers of data contribution to clinical research networks. METHODS: 
      We designed and implemented a health data transformation and loading approach, 
      which we refer to as Dynamic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) 
      (D-ETL), that automates part of the process through use of scalable, reusable and 
      customizable code, while retaining manual aspects of the process that requires 
      knowledge of complex coding syntax. This approach provides the flexibility 
      required for the ETL of heterogeneous data, variations in semantic expertise, and 
      transparency of transformation logic that are essential to implement ETL 
      conventions across clinical research sharing networks. Processing workflows are 
      directed by the ETL specifications guideline, developed by ETL designers with 
      extensive knowledge of the structure and semantics of health data (i.e., "health 
      data domain experts") and target common data model. RESULTS: D-ETL was 
      implemented to perform ETL operations that load data from various sources with 
      different database schema structures into the Observational Medical Outcome 
      Partnership (OMOP) common data model. The results showed that ETL rule 
      composition methods and the D-ETL engine offer a scalable solution for health 
      data transformation via automatic query generation to harmonize source datasets. 
      CONCLUSIONS: D-ETL supports a flexible and transparent process to transform and 
      load health data into a target data model. This approach offers a solution that 
      lowers technical barriers that prevent data partners from participating in 
      research data networks, and therefore, promotes the advancement of comparative 
      effectiveness research using secondary electronic health data.

COIS- ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: The work described in this paper 
      describes ETL infrastructure development, testing, and implementation, but does 
      not describe any research using this infrastructure. The ETL tool is implemented 
      behind data owners’ firewalls, or behind firewalls of those with whom data owners 
      have HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). Ethical and legal approvals for 
      this work are as follows: 1. The IRB approved an “infrastructure protocol”, 
      indicating that the infrastructure was an approved mechanism for producing and 
      transmitting HIPAA limited data sets for future research. 2. Any data released 
      for research would require separate IRB approval and HIPAA data use agreements 
      with data owners. 3. Data owners signed a legal document (“Master Consortium 
      Agreement”) developed in collaboration with university legal counsel and each 
      organization’ own legal counsel, specifying conditions under which the ETL tool 
      is implemented, maintained, and used to produce research data sets within the 
      research network. 4. For development and testing, several data owners provided 
      fully identified patient data to the software developers, under HIPAA BAAs 
      between the data owners and the university (also covering contractors). These 
      data were not used for research. These data governance processes were discussed 
      in great detail and established as described with legal and regulatory officials 
      from the university and data owners. CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION: Not applicable.

TI  - Tailoring Rule-Based Data Quality Assessment to the Patient-Centered Outcomes 
      Research Network (PCORnet) Common Data Model (CDM).
PG  - 775-784
AB  - Individual researchers and research networks have developed and applied different 
      approaches to assess the data quality of electronic health record (EHR) data. A 
      previously published rules-based method to evaluate the data quality of EHR data 
      provides deeper levels of data quality analysis. To examine the effectiveness and 
      generalizability of the rule-based framework, we reprogrammed and translated 
      published rule templates to operate against the PCORnet Common Data Model and 
      executed them against a database for a single center of the Greater Plains 
      Collaborative (GPC) PCORnet Clinical Research Network. The framework detected 
      additional data errors and logical inconsistencies not revealed by current data 
      quality procedures. Laboratory and medication data were more vulnerable to 
      errors. Hemolyzed samples in the emergency department and metformin prescribing 
      in ambulatory clinics are further described to illustrate application of specific 
      rule-based findings by researchers to engage their health systems in evaluating 
      healthcare delivery and clinical quality concerns.

TI  - Converting clinical document architecture documents to the common data model for 
      incorporating health information exchange data in observational health studies: 
      CDA to CDM.
PG  - 103459
LID - S1532-0464(20)30087-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization of standard health information exchange (HIE) data is 
      growing due to the high adoption rate and interoperability of electronic health 
      record (EHR) systems. However, integration of HIE data into an EHR system is not 
      yet fully adopted in clinical research. In addition, data quality should be 
      verified for the secondary use of these data. Thus, the aims of this study were 
      to convert referral documents in a Health Level 7 (HL7) clinical document 
      architecture (CDA) to the common data model (CDM) to facilitate HIE data 
      availability for longitudinal data analysis, and to identify data quality levels 
      for application in future clinical studies. METHODS: A total of 21,492 referral 
      CDA documents accumulated for over 10 years in a tertiary general hospital in 
      South Korea were analyzed. To convert CDA documents to the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, processes such as CDA parsing, data cleaning, 
      standard vocabulary mapping, CDA-to-CDM mapping, and CDM conversion were 
      performed. The quality of CDM data was then evaluated using the Achilles Heel and 
      visualized with the Achilles tool. RESULTS: Mapping five CDA elements (document 
      header, problem, medication, laboratory, and procedure) into an OMOP CDM table 
      resulted in population of 9 CDM tables (person, visit_occurrence, 
      condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, measurement, observation, 
      procedure_occurrence, care_site, and provider). Three CDM tables (drug_era, 
      condition_era, and observation_period) were derived from the converted table. 
      From vocabulary mapping codes in CDA documents according to domain, 98.6% of 
      conditions, 68.8% of drugs, 35.7% of measurements, 100% of observation, and 56.4% 
      of procedures were mapped as standard concepts. The conversion rates of the CDA 
      to the OMOP CDM were 96.3% for conditions, 97.2% for drug exposure, 98.1% for 
      procedure occurrence, 55.1% for measurements, and 100% for observation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We examined the possibility of CDM conversion by defining mapping 
      rules for CDA-to-CDM conversion using the referral CDA documents collected from 
      clinics in actual medical practice. Although mapping standard vocabulary for CDM 
      conversion requires further improvement, the conversion could facilitate further 
      research on the usage patterns of medical resources and referral patterns.

PG  - 793-797

AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel System uses a distributed data 
      network, a common data model, curated real-world data, and distributed analytic 
      tools to generate evidence for FDA decision-making. Sentinel system needs include 
      analytic flexibility, transparency, and reproducibility while protecting patient 
      privacy. Based on over a decade of experience, a critical system limitation is 
      the inability to identify enough medical conditions of interest in observational 
      data to a satisfactory level of accuracy. Improving the system's ability to use 
      computable phenotypes will require an "all of the above" approach that improves 
      use of electronic health data while incorporating the growing array of 
      complementary electronic health record data sources. FDA recently funded a 
      Sentinel System Innovation Center and a Community Building and Outreach Center 
      that will provide a platform for collaboration across disciplines to promote 
      better use of real-world data for decision-making.

TI  - Transforming and evaluating the UK Biobank to the OMOP Common Data Model for 
      COVID-19 research and beyond.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the 
      value of real-world data for public health research. International federated 
      analyses are crucial for informing policy makers. Common data models (CDMs) are 
      critical for enabling these studies to be performed efficiently. Our objective 
      was to convert the UK Biobank, a study of 500 000 participants with rich genetic 
      and phenotypic data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We converted UK Biobank data to OMOP CDM v. 5.3. We 
      transformedparticipant research data on diseases collected at recruitment and 
      electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care, hospitalizations, cancer 
      registrations, and mortality from providers in England, Scotland, and Wales. We 
      performed syntactic and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk 
      factors between source and transformed data. RESULTS: We identified 502 505 
      participants (3086 with COVID-19) and transformed 690 fields (1 373 239 555 rows) 
      to the OMOP CDM using 8 different controlled clinical terminologies and bespoke 
      mappings. Specifically, we transformed self-reported noncancer illnesses 946 053 
      (83.91% of all source entries), cancers 37 802 (70.81%), medications 1 218 935 
      (88.25%), and prescriptions 864 788 (86.96%). In EHR, we transformed 13 028 182 
      (99.95%) hospital diagnoses, 6 465 399 (89.2%) procedures, 337 896 333 primary 
      care diagnoses (CTV3, SNOMED-CT), 139 966 587 (98.74%) prescriptions (dm+d) and 
      77 127 (99.95%) deaths (ICD-10). We observed good concordance across demographic, 
      risk factor, and comorbidity factors between source and transformed data. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can be 
      successfully leveraged to harmonize complex large-scale biobanked studies 
      combining rich multimodal phenotypic data. Our study uncovered several challenges 
      when transforming data from questionnaires to the OMOP CDM which require further 
      research. The transformed UK Biobank resource is a valuable tool that can enable 
      federated research, like COVID-19 studies.

TI  - EHR-Independent Predictive Decision Support Architecture Based on OMOP.
PG  - 399-404
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1710393 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing availability of molecular and clinical data of cancer 
      patients combined with novel machine learning techniques has the potential to 
      enhance clinical decision support, example, for assessing a patient's relapse 
      risk. While these prediction models often produce promising results, a deployment 
      in clinical settings is rarely pursued. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we demonstrate 
      how prediction tools can be integrated generically into a clinical setting and 
      provide an exemplary use case for predicting relapse risk in melanoma patients. 
      METHODS: To make the decision support architecture independent of the electronic 
      health record (EHR) and transferable to different hospital environments, it was 
      based on the widely used Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common 
      data model (CDM) rather than on a proprietary EHR data structure. The usability 
      of our exemplary implementation was evaluated by means of conducting user 
      interviews including the thinking-aloud protocol and the system usability scale 
      (SUS) questionnaire. RESULTS: An extract-transform-load process was developed to 
      extract relevant clinical and molecular data from their original sources and map 
      them to OMOP. Further, the OMOP WebAPI was adapted to retrieve all data for a 
      single patient and transfer them into the decision support Web application for 
      enabling physicians to easily consult the prediction service including monitoring 
      of transferred data. The evaluation of the application resulted in a SUS score of 
      86.7. CONCLUSION: This work proposes an EHR-independent means of integrating 
      prediction models for deployment in clinical settings, utilizing the OMOP CDM. 
      The usability evaluation revealed that the application is generally suitable for 
      routine use while also illustrating small aspects for improvement.

TI  - Contextualising adverse events of special interest to characterise the baseline 
      incidence rates in 24 million patients with COVID-19 across 26 databases: a 
      multinational retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 101932
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.101932 [doi]
LID - 101932
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were pre-specified to be 
      monitored for the COVID-19 vaccines. Some AESIs are not only associated with the 
      vaccines, but with COVID-19. Our aim was to characterise the incidence rates of 
      AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and compare these to historical 
      rates in the general population. METHODS: A multi-national cohort study with data 
      from primary care, electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a 
      common data model. This study's evidence was collected between Jan 1, 2017 and 
      the conclusion of each database (which ranged from Jul 2020 to May 2022). The 16 
      pre-specified prevalent AESIs were: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, 
      appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular 
      coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain- Barré syndrome, haemorrhagic stroke, 
      non-haemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, 
      narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, transverse myelitis, and thrombosis with 
      thrombocytopenia. Age-sex standardised incidence rate ratios (SIR) were estimated 
      to compare post-COVID-19 to pre-pandemic rates in each of the databases. 
      FINDINGS: Substantial heterogeneity by age was seen for AESI rates, with some 
      clearly increasing with age but others following the opposite trend. Similarly, 
      differences were also observed across databases for same health outcome and 
      age-sex strata. All studied AESIs appeared consistently more common in the 
      post-COVID-19 compared to the historical cohorts, with related meta-analytic SIRs 
      ranging from 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66) for narcolepsy to 11.70 (10.10 to 13.70) for 
      pulmonary embolism. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest all AESIs are more 
      common after COVID-19 than in the general population. Thromboembolic events were 
      particularly common, and over 10-fold more so. More research is needed to 
      contextualise post-COVID-19 complications in the longer term. FUNDING: None.

AB  - The Kaiser Permanente & Strategic Partners Patient Outcomes Research To Advance 
      Learning (PORTAL) network engages four healthcare delivery systems (Kaiser 
      Permanente, Group Health Cooperative, HealthPartners, and Denver Health) and 
      their affiliated research centers to create a new national network infrastructure 
      that builds on existing relationships among these institutions. PORTAL is 
      enhancing its current capabilities by expanding the scope of the common data 
      model, paying particular attention to incorporating patient-reported data more 
      systematically, implementing new multi-site data governance procedures, and 
      integrating the PCORnet PopMedNet platform across our research centers. PORTAL is 
      partnering with clinical research and patient experts to create cohorts of 
      patients with a common diagnosis (colorectal cancer), a rare diagnosis 
      (adolescents and adults with severe congenital heart disease), and adults who are 
      overweight or obese, including those with pre-diabetes or diabetes, to conduct 
      large-scale observational comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic 
      clinical trials across diverse clinical care settings.

TI  - Transformation and Evaluation of the MIMIC Database in the OMOP Common Data 
      Model: Development and Usability Study.
PG  - e30970
LID - 10.2196/30970 [doi]
LID - e30970
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the era of big data, the intensive care unit (ICU) is likely to 
      benefit from real-time computer analysis and modeling based on close patient 
      monitoring and electronic health record data. The Medical Information Mart for 
      Intensive Care (MIMIC) is the first open access database in the ICU domain. Many 
      studies have shown that common data models (CDMs) improve database searching by 
      allowing code, tools, and experience to be shared. The Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is spreading all over the world. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective was to transform MIMIC into an OMOP database and to evaluate the 
      benefits of this transformation for analysts. METHODS: We transformed MIMIC 
      (version 1.4.21) into OMOP format (version 5.3.3.1) through semantic and 
      structural mapping. The structural mapping aimed at moving the MIMIC data into 
      the right place in OMOP, with some data transformations. The mapping was divided 
      into 3 phases: conception, implementation, and evaluation. The conceptual mapping 
      aimed at aligning the MIMIC local terminologies to OMOP's standard ones. It 
      consisted of 3 phases: integration, alignment, and evaluation. A documented, 
      tested, versioned, exemplified, and open repository was set up to support the 
      transformation and improvement of the MIMIC community's source code. The 
      resulting data set was evaluated over a 48-hour datathon. RESULTS: With an 
      investment of 2 people for 500 hours, 64% of the data items of the 26 MIMIC 
      tables were standardized into the OMOP CDM and 78% of the source concepts mapped 
      to reference terminologies. The model proved its ability to support community 
      contributions and was well received during the datathon, with 160 participants 
      and 15,000 requests executed with a maximum duration of 1 minute. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The resulting MIMIC-OMOP data set is the first MIMIC-OMOP data set available free 
      of charge with real disidentified data ready for replicable intensive care 
      research. This approach can be generalized to any medical field.

TI  - An OMOP CDM-Based Relational Database of Clinical Research Eligibility Criteria.
PG  - 950-954
AB  - Eligibility criteria are important for clinical research protocols or clinical 
      practice guidelines for determining who qualify for studies and to whom clinical 
      evidence is applicable, but the free-text format is not amenable for 
      computational processing. In this paper, we described a practical method for 
      transforming free-text clinical research eligibility criteria of Alzheimer's 
      clinical trials into a structured relational database compliant with standards 
      for medical terminologies and clinical data models. We utilized a hybrid natural 
      language processing system and a concept normalization tool to extract medical 
      terms in clinical research eligibility criteria and represent them using the OMOP 
      Common Data Model (CDM) v5. We created a database schema design to store 
      syntactic relations to facilitate efficient cohort queries. We further discussed 
      the potential of applying this method to trials on other diseases and the promise 
      of using it to accelerate clinical research with electronic health records.

TI  - Creation of a Multicenter Pediatric Inpatient Data Repository Derived from 
      Electronic Health Records.
PG  - 307-315
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1688477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Integration of electronic health records (EHRs) data across sites and 
      access to that data remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We developed an EHR-based 
      pediatric inpatient repository using nine U.S. centers from the National 
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development Pediatric Trials Network. 
      METHODS: A data model encompassing 147 mandatory and 99 optional elements was 
      developed to provide an EHR data extract of all inpatient encounters from 
      patients <17 years of age discharged between January 6, 2013 and June 30, 2017. 
      Sites received instructions on extractions, transformation, testing, and 
      transmission to the coordinating center. RESULTS: We generated 177 staging 
      reports to process all nine sites' 147 mandatory and 99 optional data elements to 
      the repository. Based on 520 prespecified criteria, all sites achieved 0% errors 
      and <2% warnings. The repository includes 386,159 inpatient encounters from 
      264,709 children to support study design and conduct of future trials in 
      children. CONCLUSION: Our EHR-based data repository of pediatric inpatient 
      encounters utilized a customized data model heavily influenced by the PCORnet 
      format, site-based data mapping, a comprehensive set of data testing rules, and 
      an iterative process of data submission. The common data model, site-based 
      extraction, and technical expertise were key to our success. Data from this 
      repository will be used in support of Pediatric Trials Network studies and the 
      labeling of drugs and devices for children.

LID - 3
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Distributed research networks (DRNs) are critical components of the 
      strategic roadmaps for the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug 
      Administration as they work to move toward large-scale systems of evidence 
      generation. The National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet®) is 
      one of the first DRNs to incorporate electronic health record data from multiple 
      domains on a national scale. Before conducting analyses in a DRN, it is important 
      to assess the quality and characteristics of the data. METHODS: PCORnet's 
      Coordinating Center is responsible for evaluating foundational data quality, or 
      assessing fitness-for-use across a broad research portfolio, through a process 
      called data curation. Data curation involves a set of analytic and querying 
      activities to assess data quality coupled with maintenance of detailed 
      documentation and ongoing communication with network partners. The first cycle of 
      PCORnet data curation focused on six domains in the PCORnet common data model: 
      demographics, diagnoses, encounters, enrollment, procedures, and vitals. RESULTS: 
      The data curation process led to improvements in foundational data quality. 
      Notable improvements included the elimination of data model conformance errors; a 
      decrease in implausible height, weight, and blood pressure values; an increase in 
      the volume of diagnoses and procedures; and more complete data for key analytic 
      variables. Based on the findings of the first cycle, we made modifications to the 
      curation process to increase efficiencies and further reduce variation among data 
      partners. DISCUSSION: The iterative nature of the data curation process allows 
      PCORnet to gradually increase the foundational level of data quality and reduce 
      variability across the network. These activities help increase the transparency 
      and reproducibility of analyses within PCORnet and can serve as a model for other 
      DRNs.

TI  - Integrating Electronic Health Record Data into the ADEpedia-on-OHDSI Platform for 
      Improved Signal Detection: A Case Study of Immune-related Adverse Events.
PG  - 710-719
AB  - With widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), Real World Data and 
      Real World Evidence (RWE) have been increasingly used by FDA for evaluating drug 
      safety and effectiveness. However, integration of heterogeneous drug safety data 
      sources and systems remains an impediment for effective pharmacovigilance 
      studies. In an ongoing project, we have developed a next generation 
      pharmacovigilance signal detection framework known as ADEpedia-on-OHDSI using the 
      OMOP common data model (CDM). The objective of the study is to demonstrate the 
      feasibility of the framework for integrating both spontaneous reporting data and 
      EHR data for improved signal detection with a case study of immune-related 
      adverse events. We first loaded the OMOP CDM with both recent and legacy FAERS 
      (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) data (from the time period between Jan. 2004 
      and Dec. 2018). We also integrated the clinical data from the Mayo Clinic EHR 
      system for six oncological immunotherapy drugs. We implemented a signal detection 
      algorithm and compared the timelines of positive signals detected from both FAERS 
      and EHR data. We found that the signals detected from EHRs are 4 months earlier 
      than signals detected from FAERS database (depending on the signal detection 
      methods used) for the ipilimumab-induced hypopituitarism. Our CDM-based approach 
      would be useful to provide a scalable solution to integrate both drug safety data 
      and EHR data to generate RWE for improved signal detection.

TI  - Advancing Toward a Common Data Model in Ophthalmology: Gap Analysis of General 
      Eye Examination Concepts to Standard Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      (OMOP) Concepts.
PG  - 100391
LID - 10.1016/j.xops.2023.100391 [doi]
LID - 100391
AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluate the degree of concept coverage of the general eye examination 
      in one widely used electronic health record (EHR) system using the Observational 
      Health Data Sciences and Informatics Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      (OMOP) common data model (CDM). DESIGN: Study of data elements. PARTICIPANTS: Not 
      applicable. METHODS: Data elements (field names and predefined entry values) from 
      the general eye examination in the Epic foundation system were mapped to OMOP 
      concepts and analyzed. Each mapping was given a Health Level 7 equivalence 
      designation-equal when the OMOP concept had the same meaning as the source EHR 
      concept, wider when it was missing information, narrower when it was overly 
      specific, and unmatched when there was no match. Initial mappings were reviewed 
      by 2 graders. Intergrader agreement for equivalence designation was calculated 
      using Cohen's kappa. Agreement on the mapped OMOP concept was calculated as a 
      percentage of total mappable concepts. Discrepancies were discussed and a final 
      consensus created. Quantitative analysis was performed on wider and unmatched 
      concepts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gaps in OMOP concept coverage of EHR elements 
      and intergrader agreement of mapped OMOP concepts. RESULTS: A total of 698 data 
      elements (210 fields, 488 values) from the EHR were analyzed. The intergrader 
      kappa on the equivalence designation was 0.88 (standard error 0.03, P < 0.001). 
      There was a 96% agreement on the mapped OMOP concept. In the final consensus 
      mapping, 25% (1% fields, 31% values) of the EHR to OMOP concept mappings were 
      considered equal, 50% (27% fields, 60% values) wider, 4% (8% fields, 2% values) 
      narrower, and 21% (52% fields, 8% values) unmatched. Of the wider mapped 
      elements, 46% were missing the laterality specification, 24% had other missing 
      attributes, and 30% had both issues. Wider and unmatched EHR elements could be 
      found in all areas of the general eye examination. CONCLUSIONS: Most data 
      elements in the general eye examination could not be represented precisely using 
      the OMOP CDM. Our work suggests multiple ways to improve the incorporation of 
      important ophthalmology concepts in OMOP, including adding laterality to existing 
      concepts. There exists a strong need to improve the coverage of ophthalmic 
      concepts in source vocabularies so that the OMOP CDM can better accommodate 
      vision research. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: Proprietary or commercial disclosure may 
      be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.

TI  - Investigation of hepatic adverse events due to quetiapine by using the common 
      data model.
PG  - 1341-1349
LID - 10.1002/pds.5663 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Quetiapine is a drug used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and 
      major depressive disorder. However, it can cause mild or severe hepatic adverse 
      events and rarely fatal liver damage. This study was aimed at investigating 
      hepatic toxicity caused by quetiapine use by analyzing the information captured 
      from hospital electronic health records by using the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership common data model (CDM). METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      observational study involving a nested case-control method. A CDM based on an 
      electronic health record database from five hospitals between January 2009 and 
      May 2020 was used. We analyzed the status of quetiapine use, adverse events, and 
      hepatic impairment. RESULTS: The numbers of patients with non-serious and severe 
      hepatic adverse reactions were 2566 (5.05%) and 835 (1.64%) out of 50 766 
      patients, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratio of hepatic 
      adverse events was 2.35 (95% CI: 2.03-2.72), and the odds ratio of severe hepatic 
      adverse events was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.16-2.66). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 
      that quetiapine should be cautiously used, and hepatic function should be 
      monitored in patients using quetiapine because it can cause mild or severe 
      hepatic adverse events, complications, and in rare cases, fatal liver damage.

TI  - Pitfalls in Analyzing FHIR Data from Different University Hospitals.
PG  - 146-151
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230706 [doi]
AB  - The German Medical Informatics Initiative has agreed on a HL7 FHIR-based core 
      data set as the common data model that all 37 university hospitals use for their 
      patient's data. These data are stored locally at the site but are centrally 
      queryable for researchers and accessible upon request. This infrastructure is 
      currently under construction, and its functionality is being tested by so-called 
      Projectathons. In the 6th Projectathon, a clinical hypothesis was formulated, 
      executed in a multicenter scenario, and its results were analyzed. A number of 
      oddities emerged in the analysis of data from different sites. Biometricians, who 
      had previously performed analyses in prospective data collection settings such as 
      clinical trials or cohorts, were not consistently aware of these idiosyncrasies. 
      This field report describes data quality problems that have occurred, although 
      not all are genuine errors. The aim is to point out such circumstances of data 
      generation that may affect statistical analysis.

TI  - Creating a health informatics data resource for hearing health research.
PG  - 209
LID - 10.1186/s12911-024-02589-x [doi]
LID - 209
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Health and Social Care Research (NIHR) 
      Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) for Hearing Health has been established in 
      the UK to curate routinely collected hearing health data to address research 
      questions. This study defines priority research areas, outlines its aims, 
      governance structure and demonstrates how hearing health data have been 
      integrated into a common data model using pure tone audiometry (PTA) as a case 
      study. METHODS: After identifying key research aims in hearing health, the 
      governance structure for the NIHR HIC for Hearing Health is described. The 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) was chosen as our common data 
      model to provide a case study example. RESULTS: The NIHR HIC Hearing Health theme 
      have developed a data architecture outlying the flow of data from all of the 
      various siloed electronic patient record systems to allow the effective linkage 
      of data from electronic patient record systems to research systems. Using PTAs as 
      an example, OMOPification of hearing health data successfully collated a rich 
      breadth of datapoints across multiple centres. CONCLUSION: This study identified 
      priority research areas where routinely collected hearing health data could be 
      useful. It demonstrates integration and standardisation of such data into a 
      common data model from multiple centres. By describing the process of data 
      sharing across the HIC, we hope to invite more centres to contribute and utilise 
      data to address research questions in hearing health. This national initiative 
      has the power to transform UK hearing research and hearing care using routinely 
      collected clinical data.

TI  - The Data Gap in the EHR for Clinical Research Eligibility Screening.
PG  - 320-329
AB  - Much effort has been devoted to leverage EHR data for matching patients into 
      clinical trials. However, EHRs may not contain all important data elements for 
      clinical research eligibility screening. To better design research-friendly EHRs, 
      an important step is to identify data elements frequently used for eligibility 
      screening but not yet available in EHRs. This study fills this knowledge gap. 
      Using the Alzheimer's disease domain as an example, we performed text mining on 
      the eligibility criteria text in Clinicaltrials.gov to identify frequently used 
      eligibility criteria concepts. We compared them to the EHR data elements of a 
      cohort of Alzheimer's Disease patients to assess the data gap by usingthe OMOP 
      Common Data Model to standardize the representations for both criteria concepts 
      and EHR data elements. We identified the most common SNOMED CT concepts used in 
      Alzheimer 's Disease trials, andfound 40% of common eligibility criteria concepts 
      were not even defined in the concept space in the EHR dataset for a cohort of 
      Alzheimer 'sDisease patients, indicating a significant data gap may impede 
      EHR-based eligibility screening. The results of this study can be useful for 
      designing targeted research data collection forms to help fill the data gap in 
      the EHR.

TI  - Deep Learning Approach to Parse Eligibility Criteria in Dietary Supplements 
      Clinical Trials Following OMOP Common Data Model.
PG  - 243-252
AB  - Dietary supplements (DSs) have been widely used in the U.S. and evaluated in 
      clinical trials as potential interventions for various diseases. However, many 
      clinical trials face challenges in recruiting enough eligible patients in a 
      timely fashion, causing delays or even early termination. Using electronic health 
      records to find eligible patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria 
      has been shown as a promising way to assess recruitment feasibility and 
      accelerate the recruitment process. In this study, we analyzed the eligibility 
      criteria of 100 randomly selected DS clinical trials and identified both 
      computable and non-computable criteria. We mapped annotated entities to OMOP 
      Common Data Model (CDM) with novel entities (e.g., DS). We also evaluated a deep 
      learning model (Bi-LSTM-CRF) for extracting these entities on CLAMP platform, 
      with an average F1 measure of 0.601. This study shows the feasibility of 
      automatic parsing of the eligibility criteria following OMOP CDM for future 
      cohort identification.

TI  - Patient-Level Fall Risk Prediction Using the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership's Common Data Model: Pilot Feasibility Study.
PG  - e35104
LID - 10.2196/35104 [doi]
LID - e35104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls in acute care settings threaten patients' safety. Researchers 
      have been developing fall risk prediction models and exploring risk factors to 
      provide evidence-based fall prevention practices; however, such efforts are 
      hindered by insufficient samples, limited covariates, and a lack of standardized 
      methodologies that aid study replication. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study 
      were to (1) convert fall-related electronic health record data into the 
      standardized Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's (OMOP) common data model 
      format and (2) develop models that predict fall risk during 2 time periods. 
      METHODS: As a pilot feasibility test, we converted fall-related electronic health 
      record data (nursing notes, fall risk assessment sheet, patient acuity assessment 
      sheet, and clinical observation sheet) into standardized OMOP common data model 
      format using an extraction, transformation, and load process. We developed fall 
      risk prediction models for 2 time periods (within 7 days of admission and during 
      the entire hospital stay) using 2 algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and 
      selection operator logistic regression and random forest). RESULTS: In total, 
      6277 nursing statements, 747,049,486 clinical observation sheet records, 
      1,554,775 fall risk scores, and 5,685,011 patient acuity scores were converted 
      into OMOP common data model format. All our models (area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve 0.692-0.726) performed better than the Hendrich II 
      Fall Risk Model. Patient acuity score, fall history, age ≥60 years, movement 
      disorder, and central nervous system agents were the most important predictors in 
      the logistic regression models. CONCLUSIONS: To enhance model performance 
      further, we are currently converting all nursing records into the OMOP common 
      data model data format, which will then be included in the models. Thus, in the 
      near future, the performance of fall risk prediction models could be improved 
      through the application of abundant nursing records and external validation.

AB  - Electronically stored medical records offer a rich source of data for 
      investigating treatment trajectories and identifying best practices in 
      healthcare. These trajectories, which consist of medical interventions, give us a 
      foundation to evaluate the economics of treatment patterns and model the 
      treatment paths. The aim of this work is to introduce a technical solution for 
      the aforementioned tasks. The developed tools use the open source Observational 
      Health Data Sciences and Informatics Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      Common Data Model to construct treatment trajectories and implement these to 
      compose Markov models for composing financial analysis between standard of care 
      and alternatives.

TI  - Transforming Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis and Staging Information from Unstructured 
      Reports to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model.
PG  - 521-531
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1748144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer staging information is an essential component of cancer 
      research. However, the information is primarily stored as either a full or 
      semistructured free-text clinical document which is limiting the data use. By 
      transforming the cancer-specific data to the Observational Medical Outcome 
      Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), the information can contribute to 
      establish multicenter observational cancer studies. To the best of our knowledge, 
      there have been no studies on OMOP CDM transformation and natural language 
      processing (NLP) for thyroid cancer to date. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to demonstrate 
      the applicability of the OMOP CDM oncology extension module for thyroid cancer 
      diagnosis and cancer stage information by processing free-text medical reports. 
      METHODS: Thyroid cancer diagnosis and stage-related modifiers were extracted with 
      rule-based NLP from 63,795 thyroid cancer pathology reports and 56,239 Iodine 
      whole-body scan reports from three medical institutions in the Observational 
      Health Data Sciences and Informatics data network. The data were converted into 
      the OMOP CDM v6.0 according to the OMOP CDM oncology extension module. The cancer 
      staging group was derived and populated using the transformed CDM data. RESULTS: 
      The extracted thyroid cancer data were completely converted into the OMOP CDM. 
      The distributions of histopathological types of thyroid cancer were approximately 
      95.3 to 98.8% of papillary carcinoma, 0.9 to 3.7% of follicular carcinoma, 0.04 
      to 0.54% of adenocarcinoma, 0.17 to 0.81% of medullary carcinoma, and 0 to 0.3% 
      of anaplastic carcinoma. Regarding cancer staging, stage-I thyroid cancer 
      accounted for 55 to 64% of the cases, while stage III accounted for 24 to 26% of 
      the cases. Stage-II and -IV thyroid cancers were detected at a low rate of 2 to 
      6%. CONCLUSION: As a first study on OMOP CDM transformation and NLP for thyroid 
      cancer, this study will help other institutions to standardize thyroid 
      cancer-specific data for retrospective observational research and participate in 
      multicenter studies.

PG  - 226-229
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230469 [doi]
AB  - Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are a crucial public health issue due to the 
      significant health and monetary burden that they can impose. Real-World Data 
      (RWD), e.g., Electronic Health Records, claims data, etc., can support the 
      identification of potentially unknown ADRs and thus, they could provide raw data 
      to mine ADR prevention rules. The PrescIT project aims to create a Clinical 
      Decision Support System (CDSS) for ADR prevention during ePrescription and uses 
      OMOP-CDM as the main data model to mine ADR prevention rules, based on the 
      software stack provided by the OHDSI initiative. This paper presents the 
      deployment of OMOP-CDM infrastructure using the MIMIC-III as a testbed.

      Concept.
PG  - 63-67
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210815 [doi]
AB  - Generating evidence based on real-world data is gaining importance in research 
      not least since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Common Data Model of Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is a research infrastructure that implements 
      FAIR principles. Although the transfer of German claim data to OMOP is already 
      implemented, drug data is an open issue. This paper provides a concept to prepare 
      electronic health record (EHR) drug data for the transfer to OMOP based on 
      requirements analysis and descriptive statistics for profiling EHR data developed 
      by an interdisciplinary team and also covers data quality issues. The concept not 
      only ensures FAIR principles for research, but provides the foundation for German 
      drug data to OMOP transfer.

      research, improves patient outcomes, and guides policy. This secondary data, as 
      found in electronic medical records (EMRs), can be optimised through conversion 
      into a uniform data structure to enable analysis alongside other comparable 
      health metric datasets. This can be achieved with the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), which employs a standardised 
      vocabulary to facilitate systematic analysis across various observational 
      databases. The concept behind the OMOP-CDM is the conversion of data into a 
      common format through the harmonisation of terminologies, vocabularies, and 
      coding schemes within a unique repository. The OMOP model enhances research 
      capacity through the development of shared analytic and prediction techniques; 
      pharmacovigilance for the active surveillance of drug safety; and 'validation' 
      analyses across multiple institutions across Australia, the United States, 
      Europe, and the Asia Pacific. In this research, we aim to investigate the use of 
      the open-source OMOP-CDM in the PATRON primary care data repository. METHODS: We 
      used standard structured query language (SQL) to construct, extract, transform, 
      and load scripts to convert the data to the OMOP-CDM. The process of mapping 
      distinct free-text terms extracted from various EMRs presented a substantial 
      challenge, as many terms could not be automatically matched to standard 
      vocabularies through direct text comparison. This resulted in a number of terms 
      that required manual assignment. To address this issue, we implemented a strategy 
      where our clinical mappers were instructed to focus only on terms that appeared 
      with sufficient frequency. We established a specific threshold value for each 
      domain, ensuring that more than 95% of all records were linked to an approved 
      vocabulary like SNOMED once appropriate mapping was completed. To assess the data 
      quality of the resultant OMOP dataset we utilised the OHDSI Data Quality 
      Dashboard (DQD) to evaluate the plausibility, conformity, and comprehensiveness 
      of the data in the PATRON repository according to the Kahn framework. RESULTS: 
      Across three primary care EMR systems we converted data on 2.03 million active 
      patients to version 5.4 of the OMOP common data model. The DQD assessment 
      involved a total of 3,570 individual evaluations. Each evaluation compared the 
      outcome against a predefined threshold. A 'FAIL' occurred when the percentage of 
      non-compliant rows exceeded the specified threshold value. In this assessment of 
      the primary care OMOP database described here, we achieved an overall pass rate 
      of 97%. CONCLUSION: The OMOP CDM's widespread international use, support, and 
      training provides a well-established pathway for data standardisation in 
      collaborative research. Its compatibility allows the sharing of analysis packages 
      across local and international research groups, which facilitates rapid and 
      reproducible data comparisons. A suite of open-source tools, including the OHDSI 
      Data Quality Dashboard (Version 1.4.1), supports the model. Its simplicity and 
      standards-based approach facilitates adoption and integration into existing data 
      processes.

BTI - Looking at the Effects of Antibiotic Use on Childhood Obesity and Growth—The 
      PCORnet® Antibiotics Study
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated associations between antibiotic use in 
      early life and higher weight in later childhood. Lingering questions regarding 
      this association include potential heterogeneity of treatment effects: the 
      timing, type, and number of antibiotic exposures in early life; and differential 
      effects of antibiotics in subgroups, such as by sex and medical comorbidities. 
      With electronic health record (EHR) and other health care data available for 
      large populations, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network 
      (PCORnet) provided a unique opportunity to investigate these questions and help 
      build the research capacity of this new network. The study was led by 3 principal 
      investigators, and the study results include data from 36 PCORnet institutions in 
      10 clinical data research networks (CDRNs). OBJECTIVES: The study aims were to 
      examine the association between antibiotic use before 24 months of age and weight 
      outcomes at ages 48 to <72 months (ie, approximately 5 years) and at 108 to 132 
      months (ie, approximately 10 years) and weight trajectories from early- to 
      mid-childhood. To explore the association of maternal antibiotic use during 
      pregnancy, we also incorporated maternal variables from the data of 7 
      participating institutions. The study had a qualitative aim to gauge opinions 
      from parents and providers about their impressions of the potential relationship 
      between antibiotics and childhood obesity, as well as an evaluation aim intended 
      to identify accomplishments and needed improvements in the development of 
      PCORnet. METHODS: For all analytic aims, the study used PCORnet's infrastructure 
      and common data model (CDM) to capture all relevant data from 2009 to 2016. The 
      CDM allows each participating institution to store its data in a standardized 
      manner, facilitating the combination of data across sites. Study cohort inclusion 
      criteria were the availability of same-day height and weight measurements at 0 to 
      <a12, 12 to <30, and >24 months of age. Using deidentified individual-level data, 
      we determined the association between antibiotic use at <24 months of age with 
      the primary outcomes of (1) body mass index (BMI) z-score and overweight or 
      obesity prevalence at 48 to <72 months (5 years) and 108 to 132 months (10 years) 
      of age; and (2) weight trajectories from 24 months of age on. In 7 institutions, 
      we were able to link data from mothers and children. For these sites, we assessed 
      whether maternal antibiotics during pregnancy were associated with child BMI 
      z-score and overweight or obesity prevalence at 48 to <72 months of age. For 
      analyses of BMI z-score and overweight or obesity prevalence, we used 
      mixed-effects regression models stratified by complex chronic condition status, 
      accounting for clustering by network partner and adjusting for demographic and 
      clinical factors, including sex, race, ethnicity, preterm birth, asthma, 
      infections, corticosteroid episodes, encounters at <24 months of age, and age at 
      outcome. We also conducted several secondary analyses, including examining 
      differential effects on BMI z-score by antibiotic spectrum (narrow and broad 
      spectrum, with further analyses of specific classes of medications within the 
      broad-spectrum category) and age period (<6 months, 6 to <12 months, and 12 to 
      <24 months) of exposures. We incorporated data on maternal characteristics from 
      the subset of institutions for which we had data available linking mothers to 
      children. For the trajectory analyses, we used longitudinal rate regression to 
      assess differences in the rates of weight change across exposure groups. The 
      study's qualitative aim used parent focus groups at 4 participating institutions 
      and telephone provider interviews using scripts developed by the study team and 
      stakeholder advisory group. We audio-recorded and transcribed focus groups and 
      interviews, coded themes identified during the review of transcripts, and 
      analyzed the code lists using a content analysis approach.(,) Because this study 
      was one of the first observational epidemiologic studies to be conducted across 
      PCORnet, an external evaluator completed an extensive review of it, along with 
      the PCORnet Bariatric Study; we report some of the findings from that evaluation. 
      RESULTS: Among 1 792 849 children with a same-day height and weight measurement 
      at <12 months of age, 362 550 children were eligible for the cohort for 5-year 
      outcomes; 430 376 children were eligible for the trajectory analysis; 56 727 
      children were eligible for 10-year outcomes; and 53 320 mother–child pairs were 
      eligible for the analysis of maternal antibiotics during pregnancy. Among 
      children who received antibiotics at <24 months of age, we found that BMI z-score 
      was slightly higher at 5 years by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.05) with slightly higher 
      odds of overweight or obesity (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07) than among 
      children who had not received antibiotics. We found modest evidence of a dose 
      response, with more antibiotic exposure translating to higher weight; the BMI 
      z-score differences were 0.07 higher [0.06-0.08] for children exposed to ≥4 
      antibiotics vs children who had no antibiotics. For 5-year-old boys and girls who 
      were at average height in this study, this difference amounted to 0.11 kg more 
      weight if exposed to ≥4 antibiotic courses (vs 0) before 24 months of age. 
      Broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with slightly higher BMI z-scores than 
      were narrow-spectrum antibiotics. We did not identify substantive differences by 
      timing of exposure, sociodemographics, and whether children had chronic diseases. 
      Effects were similar when we examined weight trajectories after 24 months and for 
      weight outcomes at 10 years. We found no association between maternal antibiotic 
      use during pregnancy and child weight outcomes. In the qualitative aim, we 
      discovered that both parents and clinicians generally prioritized providing acute 
      relief to children with an infection over the modest concern about long-term 
      risks of weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use at <24 months was associated 
      with a slightly higher weight in later childhood. Maternal antibiotic use during 
      pregnancy was not associated with weight in children. These findings likely 
      should not affect clinical decision-making regarding whether to give children 
      antibiotics, but they may be important at the population level considering the 
      widespread use of antibiotics. While completing this project, the study team 
      helped create a process for the curation and use of EHR prescribing data in 
      PCORnet. LIMITATIONS: The PCORnet CDM focuses largely on EHR data, which includes 
      prescribing data rather than dispensing data. In a limited number of 
      participating institutions, our own analyses found missing data in PCORnet 
      prescribing data compared with insurance claims and pharmacy dispensing data. In 
      addition, at the time of this study, PCORnet did not have the ability to link 
      patients across institutions. Thus, there was a possibility of duplicate patients 
      in our study data set.

TI  - Combining multiple healthcare databases for postmarketing drug and vaccine safety 
      surveillance: why and how?
PG  - 551-61
LID - 10.1111/joim.12159 [doi]
AB  - A growing number of international initiatives (e.g. EU-ADR, Sentinel, OMOP, 
      PROTECT and VAESCO) are based on the combined use of multiple healthcare 
      databases for the conduct of active surveillance studies in the area of drug and 
      vaccine safety. The motivation behind combining multiple healthcare databases is 
      the earlier detection and validation, and hence earlier management, of potential 
      safety issues. Overall, the combination of multiple healthcare databases 
      increases statistical sample size and heterogeneity of exposure for postmarketing 
      drug and vaccine safety surveillance, despite posing several technical 
      challenges. Healthcare databases generally differ by underlying healthcare 
      systems, type of information collected, drug/vaccine and medical event coding 
      systems and language. Therefore, harmonization of medical data extraction through 
      homogeneous coding algorithms across highly different databases is necessary. 
      Although no standard procedure is currently available to achieve this, several 
      approaches have been developed in recent projects. Another main challenge 
      involves choosing the work models for data management and analyses whilst 
      respecting country-specific regulations in terms of data privacy and 
      anonymization. Dedicated software (e.g. Jerboa) has been produced to deal with 
      privacy issues by sharing only anonymized and aggregated data using a common data 
      model. Finally, storage and safe access to the data from different databases 
      requires the development of a proper remote research environment. The aim of this 
      review is to provide a summary of the potential, disadvantages, methodological 
      issues and possible solutions concerning the conduct of postmarketing 
      multidatabase drug and vaccine safety studies, as demonstrated by several 
      international initiatives.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the processes developed by The Hospital for Sick Children 
      (SickKids) to enable utilization of electronic health record (EHR) data by 
      creating sequentially transformed schemas for use across multiple user types. 
      METHODS: We used Microsoft Azure as the cloud service provider and named this 
      effort the SickKids Enterprise-wide Data in Azure Repository (SEDAR). Epic 
      Clarity data from on-premises was copied to a virtual network in Microsoft Azure. 
      Three sequential schemas were developed. The Filtered Schema added a filter to 
      retain only SickKids and valid patients. The Curated Schema created a data 
      structure that was easier to navigate and query. Each table contained a logical 
      unit such as patients, hospital encounters or laboratory tests. Data validation 
      of randomly sampled observations in the Curated Schema was performed. The SK-OMOP 
      Schema was designed to facilitate research and machine learning. Two individuals 
      mapped medical elements to standard Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      (OMOP) concepts. RESULTS: A copy of Clarity data was transferred to Microsoft 
      Azure and updated each night using log shipping. The Filtered Schema and Curated 
      Schema were implemented as stored procedures and executed each night with 
      incremental updates or full loads. Data validation required up to 16 iterations 
      for each Curated Schema table. OMOP concept mapping achieved at least 80 % 
      coverage for each SK-OMOP table. CONCLUSIONS: We described our experience in 
      creating three sequential schemas to address different EHR data access 
      requirements. Future work should consider replicating this approach at other 
      institutions to determine whether approaches are generalizable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely used in 
      secondary assessments, clinical documents are relatively less utilized owing to 
      the lack of standardized clinical text frameworks across different institutions. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a framework for processing unstructured 
      clinical documents of EHRs and integration with standardized structured data. 
      METHODS: We developed a framework known as Staged Optimization of Curation, 
      Regularization, and Annotation of clinical text (SOCRATex). SOCRATex has the 
      following four aspects: (1) extracting clinical notes for the target population 
      and preprocessing the data, (2) defining the annotation schema with a 
      hierarchical structure, (3) performing document-level hierarchical annotation 
      using the annotation schema, and (4) indexing annotations for a search engine 
      system. To test the usability of the proposed framework, proof-of-concept studies 
      were performed on EHRs. We defined three distinctive patient groups and extracted 
      their clinical documents (ie, pathology reports, radiology reports, and admission 
      notes). The documents were annotated and integrated into the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-common data model (CDM) database. The 
      annotations were used for creating Cox proportional hazard models with different 
      settings of clinical analyses to measure (1) all-cause mortality, (2) thyroid 
      cancer recurrence, and (3) 30-day hospital readmission. RESULTS: Overall, 1055 
      clinical documents of 953 patients were extracted and annotated using the defined 
      annotation schemas. The generated annotations were indexed into an unstructured 
      textual data repository. Using the annotations of pathology reports, we 
      identified that node metastasis and lymphovascular tumor invasion were associated 
      with all-cause mortality among colon and rectum cancer patients (both P=.02). The 
      other analyses involving measuring thyroid cancer recurrence using radiology 
      reports and 30-day hospital readmission using admission notes in depressive 
      disorder patients also showed results consistent with previous findings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We propose a framework for hierarchical annotation of textual data 
      and integration into a standardized OMOP-CDM medical database. The 
      proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that our framework can effectively process 
      and integrate diverse clinical documents with standardized structured data for 
      clinical research.

TI  - Optimizing identification of resistant hypertension: Computable phenotype 
      development and validation.
PG  - 1393-1401
LID - 10.1002/pds.5095 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Computable phenotypes are constructed to utilize data within the 
      electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients with specific 
      characteristics; a necessary step for researching a complex disease state. We 
      developed computable phenotypes for resistant hypertension (RHTN) and stable 
      controlled hypertension (HTN) based on the National Patient-Centered Clinical 
      Research Network (PCORnet) common data model (CDM). The computable phenotypes 
      were validated through manual chart review. METHODS: We adapted and refined 
      existing computable phenotype algorithms for RHTN and stable controlled HTN to 
      the PCORnet CDM in an adult HTN population from the OneFlorida Clinical Research 
      Consortium (2015-2017). Two independent reviewers validated the computable 
      phenotypes through manual chart review of 425 patient records. We assessed 
      precision of our computable phenotypes through positive predictive value (PPV) 
      and test validity through interrater reliability (IRR). RESULTS: Among the 
      156 730 HTN patients in our final dataset, the final computable phenotype 
      algorithms identified 24 926 patients with RHTN and 19 100 with stable controlled 
      HTN. The PPV for RHTN in patients randomly selected for validation of the final 
      algorithm was 99.1% (n = 113, CI: 95.2%-99.9%). The PPV for stable controlled HTN 
      in patients randomly selected for validation of the final algorithm was 96.5% (n 
      = 113, CI: 91.2%-99.0%). IRR analysis revealed a raw percent agreement of 91% 
      (152/167) with Cohen's kappa statistic = 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: We constructed and 
      validated a RHTN computable phenotype algorithm and a stable controlled HTN 
      computable phenotype algorithm. Both algorithms are based on the PCORnet CDM, 
      allowing for future application to epidemiological and drug utilization based 
      research.

TI  - Can We Rely on Results From IQVIA Medical Research Data UK Converted to the 
      Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model?: A Validation Study 
      Based on Prescribing Codeine in Children.
PG  - 915-925
LID - 10.1002/cpt.1785 [doi]
AB  - Exploring and combining results from more than one real-world data (RWD) source 
      might be necessary in order to explore variability and demonstrate 
      generalizability of the results or for regulatory requirements. However, the 
      heterogeneous nature of RWD poses challenges when working with more than one 
      source, some of which can be solved by analyzing databases converted into a 
      common data model (CDM). The main objective of the study was to evaluate the 
      implementation of the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) CDM on 
      IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD)-UK data. A drug utilization study describing 
      the prescribing of codeine for pain in children was used as a case study to be 
      replicated in IMRD-UK and its corresponding OMOP CDM transformation. Differences 
      between IMRD-UK source and OMOP CDM were identified and investigated. In IMRD-UK 
      updated to May 2017, results were similar between source and transformed data 
      with few discrepancies. These were the result of different conventions applied 
      during the transformation regarding the date of birth for children younger than 
      15 years and the start of the observation period, and of a misclassification of 
      two drug treatments. After the initial analysis and feedback provided, a rerun of 
      the analysis in IMRD-UK updated to September 2018 showed almost identical results 
      for all the measures analyzed. For this study, the conversion to OMOP CDM was 
      adequate. Although some decisions and mapping could be improved, these impacted 
      on the absolute results but not on the study inferences. This validation study 
      supports six recommendations for good practice in transforming to CDMs.

AB  - The Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network is a federated network of sites from 
      the National Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Consortium that has 
      been created to significantly increase participant accrual to multi-site clinical 
      trials. The ACT network represents an unprecedented collaboration among diverse 
      CTSA sites. The network has created governance and regulatory frameworks and a 
      common data model to harmonize electronic health record (EHR) data, and deployed 
      a set of Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) data 
      repositories that are linked by the Shared Health Research Information Network 
      (SHRINE) platform. It provides investigators the ability to query the network in 
      real time and to obtain aggregate counts of patients who meet clinical trial 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria from sites across the United States. The ACT 
      network infrastructure provides a basis for cohort discovery and for developing 
      new informatics tools to identify and recruit participants for multi-site 
      clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda, a vast amount of 
      SARS-COV-2/COVID-19-related data have been collected including COVID-19 testing 
      and hospital routine care data. Unfortunately, those data are fragmented in silos 
      with different data structures or formats and cannot be used to improve 
      understanding of the disease, monitor its progress, and generate evidence to 
      guide prevention measures. The objective of this project is to leverage the 
      artificial intelligence (AI) and data science techniques in harmonizing datasets 
      to support Rwandan government needs in monitoring and predicting the COVID-19 
      burden, including the hospital admissions and overall infection rates. METHODS: 
      The project will gather the existing data including hospital electronic health 
      records (EHRs), the COVID-19 testing data and will link with longitudinal data 
      from community surveys. The open-source tools from Observational Health Data 
      Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) will be used to harmonize hospital EHRs through 
      the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). 
      The project will also leverage other OHDSI tools for data analytics and network 
      integration, as well as R Studio and Python. The network will include up to 15 
      health facilities in Rwanda, whose EHR data will be harmonized to OMOP CDM. 
      EXPECTED RESULTS: This study will yield a technical infrastructure where the 15 
      participating hospitals and health centres will have EHR data in OMOP CDM format 
      on a local Mac Mini ("data node"), together with a set of OHDSI open-source 
      tools. A central server, or portal, will contain a data catalogue of 
      participating sites, as well as the OHDSI tools that are used to define and 
      manage distributed studies. The central server will also integrate the 
      information from the national Covid-19 registry, as well as the results of the 
      community surveys. The ultimate project outcome is the dynamic prediction 
      modelling for COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda. DISCUSSION: The project is the first 
      on the African continent leveraging AI and implementation of an OMOP CDM based 
      federated data network for data harmonization. Such infrastructure is scalable 
      for other pandemics monitoring, outcomes predictions, and tailored response 
      planning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper presents a portable phenotyping system that is capable of 
      integrating both rule-based and statistical machine learning based approaches. 
      METHODS: Our system utilizes UMLS to extract clinically relevant features from 
      the unstructured text and then facilitates portability across different 
      institutions and data systems by incorporating OHDSI's OMOP Common Data Model 
      (CDM) to standardize necessary data elements. Our system can also store the key 
      components of rule-based systems (e.g., regular expression matches) in the format 
      of OMOP CDM, thus enabling the reuse, adaptation and extension of many existing 
      rule-based clinical NLP systems. We experimented with our system on the corpus 
      from i2b2's Obesity Challenge as a pilot study. RESULTS: Our system facilitates 
      portable phenotyping of obesity and its 15 comorbidities based on the 
      unstructured patient discharge summaries, while achieving a performance that 
      often ranked among the top 10 of the challenge participants. CONCLUSION: Our 
      system of standardization enables a consistent application of numerous rule-based 
      and machine learning based classification techniques downstream across disparate 
      datasets which may originate across different institutions and data systems.

TI  - Enhancing PCORnet Clinical Research Network data completeness by integrating 
      multistate insurance claims with electronic health records in a cloud environment 
      aligned with CMS security and privacy requirements.
PG  - 660-670
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab269 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC) and other PCORnet Clinical Data 
      Research Networks capture healthcare utilization within their health systems. 
      Here, we describe a reusable environment (GPC Reusable Observable Unified Study 
      Environment [GROUSE]) that integrates hospital and electronic health records 
      (EHRs) data with state-wide Medicare and Medicaid claims and assess how claims 
      and clinical data complement each other to identify obesity and related 
      comorbidities in a patient sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EHR, billing, and tumor 
      registry data from 7 healthcare systems were integrated with Center for Medicare 
      (2011-2016) and Medicaid (2011-2012) services insurance claims to create 
      deidentified databases in Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside and 
      PCORnet Common Data Model formats. We describe technical details of how this 
      federally compliant, cloud-based data environment was built. As a use case, 
      trends in obesity rates for different age groups are reported, along with the 
      relative contribution of claims and EHR data-to-data completeness and detecting 
      common comorbidities. RESULTS: GROUSE contained 73 billion observations from 24 
      million unique patients (12.9 million Medicare; 13.9 million Medicaid; 6.6 
      million GPC patients) with 1 674 134 patients crosswalked and 983 450 patients 
      with body mass index (BMI) linked to claims. Diagnosis codes from EHR and claims 
      sources underreport obesity by 2.56 times compared with body mass index measures. 
      However, common comorbidities such as diabetes and sleep apnea diagnoses were 
      more often available from claims diagnoses codes (1.6 and 1.4 times, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: GROUSE provides a unified EHR-claims environment to 
      address health system and federal privacy concerns, which enables investigators 
      to generalize analyses across health systems integrated with multistate insurance 
      claims.

TI  - Patient characteristics and antiseizure medication pathways in newly diagnosed 
      epilepsy: Feasibility and pilot results using the common data model in a 
      single-center electronic medical record database.
PG  - 108630
LID - S1525-5050(22)00079-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.yebeh.2022.108630 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Efforts to characterize variability in epilepsy treatment pathways 
      are limited by the large number of possible antiseizure medication (ASM) regimens 
      and sequences, heterogeneity of patients, and challenges of measuring confounding 
      variables and outcomes across institutions. The Observational Health Data Science 
      and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative is an international data network 
      representing over 1 billion patient records using common data standards. However, 
      few studies have applied OHDSI's Common Data Model (CDM) to the population with 
      epilepsy and none have validated relevant concepts. The goals of this study were 
      to demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing adult patients with epilepsy and 
      ASM treatment pathways using the CDM in an electronic health record (EHR)-derived 
      database. METHODS: We validated a phenotype algorithm for epilepsy in adults 
      using the CDM in an EHR-derived database (2001-2020) against source records and a 
      prospectively maintained database of patients with confirmed epilepsy. We 
      obtained the frequency of all antecedent conditions and procedures for patients 
      meeting the epilepsy phenotype criteria and characterized ASM exposure sequences 
      over time and by age and sex. RESULTS: The phenotype algorithm identified 
      epilepsy with 73.0-85.0% positive predictive value and 86.3% sensitivity. Many 
      patients had neurologic conditions and diagnoses antecedent to meeting epilepsy 
      criteria. Levetiracetam incrementally replaced phenytoin as the most common 
      first-line agent, but significant heterogeneity remained, particularly in 
      second-line and subsequent agents. Drug sequences included up to 8 unique 
      ingredients and a total of 1,235 unique pathways were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite the availability of additional ASMs in the last 2 decades and accumulated 
      guidelines and evidence, ASM use varies significantly in practice, particularly 
      for second-line and subsequent agents. Multi-center OHDSI studies have the 
      potential to better characterize the full extent of variability and support 
      observational comparative effectiveness research, but additional work is needed 
      to validate covariates and outcomes.

AB  - Rehabilitation research focuses on determining the components of a treatment 
      intervention, the mechanism of how these components lead to recovery and 
      rehabilitation, and ultimately the optimal intervention strategies to maximize 
      patients' physical, psychologic, and social functioning. Traditional randomized 
      clinical trials that study and establish new interventions face challenges, such 
      as high cost and time commitment. Observational studies that use existing 
      clinical data to observe the effect of an intervention have shown several 
      advantages over RCTs. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an 
      increasingly important resource for conducting observational studies. To support 
      these studies, we developed a clinical research datamart, called ReDWINE 
      (Rehabilitation Datamart With Informatics iNfrastructure for rEsearch), that 
      transforms the rehabilitation-related EHR data collected from the UPMC health 
      care system to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to 
      facilitate rehabilitation research. The standardized EHR data stored in ReDWINE 
      will further reduce the time and effort required by investigators to pool, 
      harmonize, clean, and analyze data from multiple sources, leading to more robust 
      and comprehensive research findings. ReDWINE also includes deployment of data 
      visualization and data analytics tools to facilitate cohort definition and 
      clinical data analysis. These include among others the Open Health Natural 
      Language Processing (OHNLP) toolkit, a high-throughput NLP pipeline, to provide 
      text analytical capabilities at scale in ReDWINE. Using this comprehensive 
      representation of patient data in ReDWINE for rehabilitation research will 
      facilitate real-world evidence for health interventions and outcomes.

TI  - Building an active medical product safety surveillance system in Taiwan: 
      Adaptation of the U.S. Sentinel System common data model structure to the 
      National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan.
PG  - 97-101
LID - 10.1002/pds.5168 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Using real-world data to support regulatory decision has become a global 
      movement. However, a robust platform for active surveillance of medical product 
      safety has not been established in Taiwan. METHODS: Following the common data 
      model structure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System, we 
      built the Taiwan Sentinel Data Model (TSDM) using the National Health Insurance 
      Research Database with longitudinal claims data from 23 million individuals, 
      linked death and cause of death data from a national registry, and linked 
      electronic health record data from a delivery system. We examined the conversion 
      of the TSDM using the Sentinel Data Quality Review and Characterization Programs 
      in a sample of sex- and age-stratified cohort of 3 million individuals. RESULTS: 
      The TSDM fulfilled the requirements of data quality assurance. Only about 6% of 
      sex and 0.0007% of birth year were missing, and <0.001% of date data had 
      illogical values. CONCLUSIONS: The TSDM-converted database could be a valuable 
      data resource for domestic pharmacovigilance analysis in Taiwan and cross-country 
      evaluation.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) and other real-world data (RWD) are critical to 
      accelerating and scaling care improvement and transformation. To efficiently 
      leverage it for secondary uses, EHR/RWD should be optimally managed and mapped to 
      industry standard concepts (ISCs). Inherent challenges in concept encoding 
      usually result in inefficient and costly workflows and resultant metadata 
      representation structures outside the EHR. Using three related projects to map 
      data to ISCs, we describe the development of standard, repeatable processes for 
      precisely and unambiguously representing EHR data using appropriate ISCs within 
      the EHR platform lifecycle and mappings specific to SNOMED-CT for Demographics, 
      Specialty and Services. Mappings in these 3 areas resulted in ISC mappings of 779 
      data elements requiring 90 new concept requests to SNOMED-CT and 738 new ISCs 
      mapped into the workflow within an accessible, enterprise-wide EHR resource with 
      supporting processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery has been used for treatment of severe obesity in 
      adolescents but most studies have been small and limited in follow-up. 
      OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that electronic health record data could be used to 
      compare effectiveness of bariatric procedures in adolescents. SETTING: Data were 
      obtained from clinical research networks using a common data model to extract 
      data from each site. METHODS: Adolescents who underwent a primary bariatric 
      procedure from 2005 through 2015 were identified. The percent change in body mass 
      index (BMI) at 1, 3, and 5 years was estimated using random effects linear 
      regression for patients undergoing all operations. Propensity score adjusted 
      estimates and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for procedures with >25 
      patients at each time period. RESULTS: This cohort of 544 adolescents was 
      predominantly female (79%) and White (66%), with mean (±standard deviation) age 
      of 17.3 (±1.6) years and mean BMI of 49.8 (± 7.8) kg/m(2). Procedures included 
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB; n = 177), sleeve gastrectomy (SG; n = 306), and 
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (n = 61). For those undergoing RYGB, SG, 
      and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, mean (95% confidence interval) BMI 
      changes of -31% (-30% to -33%), -28% (-27% to -29%), and -10% (-8% to -12%), were 
      estimated at 1 year. For RYGB and SG, BMI changes of -29% (-26% to -33%) and -25% 
      (-22% to -28%) were estimated at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents undergoing SG 
      and RYGB experienced greater declines in BMI at 1- and 3-year follow-up time 
      points, while laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was significantly less 
      effective for BMI reduction.

TI  - Applying the OMOP Common Data Model to Facilitate Benefit-Risk Assessments of 
      Medicinal Products Using Real-World Data from Singapore and South Korea.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the benefits of converting 
      Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to a common data model (CDM) and to assess the 
      potential of CDM-converted data to rapidly generate insights for benefit-risk 
      assessments in post-market regulatory evaluation and decisions. METHODS: EMRs 
      from January 2013 to December 2016 were mapped onto the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership-CDM (OMOP-CDM) schema. Vocabulary mappings were applied to 
      convert source data values into OMOP-CDM-endorsed terminologies. Existing 
      analytic codes used in a prior OMOP-CDM drug utilization study were modified to 
      conduct an illustrative analysis of oral anticoagulants used for atrial 
      fibrillation in Singapore and South Korea, resembling a typical benefit-risk 
      assessment. A novel visualization is proposed to represent the comparative 
      effectiveness, safety and utilization of the drugs. RESULTS: Over 90% of records 
      were mapped onto the OMOP-CDM. The CDM data structures and analytic code 
      templates simplified the querying of data for the analysis. In total, 2,419 
      patients from Singapore and South Korea fulfilled the study criteria, the 
      majority of whom were warfarin users. After 3 months of follow-up, differences in 
      cumulative incidence of bleeding and thromboembolic events were observable via 
      the proposed visualization, surfacing insights as to the agent of preference in a 
      given clinical setting, which may meaningfully inform regulatory decision-making. 
      CONCLUSIONS: While the structure of the OMOP-CDM and its accessory tools 
      facilitate real-world data analysis, extending them to fulfil regulatory analytic 
      purposes in the post-market setting, such as benefit-risk assessments, may 
      require layering on additional analytic tools and visualization techniques.

AB  - Clinical documentation in electronic health records contains crucial narratives 
      and details about patients and their care. Natural language processing (NLP) can 
      unlock the information conveyed in clinical notes and reports, and thus plays a 
      critical role in real-world studies. The NLP Working Group at the Observational 
      Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium was established to 
      develop methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and NLP in 
      real-world observational studies. In this paper, we describe a framework for 
      representing and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, 
      including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), the workflow and 
      tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical 
      notes into tables in OMOP CDM, as well as current applications and specific use 
      cases of the proposed OHDSI NLP solution at large consortia and individual 
      institutions with English textual data. Challenges faced and lessons learned 
      during the process are also discussed to provide valuable insights for 
      researchers who are planning to implement NLP solutions in real-world studies.

TI  - Applying computable phenotypes within a common data model to identify heart 
      failure patients for an implantable cardiac device registry.
PG  - 100974
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcha.2022.100974 [doi]
LID - 100974
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of existing data in electronic health records (EHRs) could be 
      used more extensively to better leverage real world data for clinical studies, 
      but only if standard, reliable processes are developed. Numerous computable 
      phenotypes have been validated against manual chart review, and common data 
      models (CDMs) exist to aid implementation of such phenotypes across platforms and 
      sites. Our objective was to measure consistency between data that had previously 
      been manually collected for an implantable cardiac device registry and CDM-based 
      phenotypes for the condition of heart failure (HF). METHODS: Patients enrolled in 
      an implantable cardiac device registry at two hospitals from 2013 to 2018 
      contributed to this analysis wherein registry data were compared to PCORnet 
      CDM-formatted EHR data. Seven different phenotype algorithms were used to search 
      for the presence of HF and compare the results with the registry. Sensitivity, 
      specificity, predictive value and congruence were calculated for each phenotype. 
      RESULTS: In the registry, 176 of 319 (55%) patients had history of HF, compared 
      with different phenotypes estimating between 96 (30%) and 188 (59%). The 
      least-restrictive phenotypes (any diagnosis) had high sensitivity and specificity 
      (90%/80%), but more restrictive phenotypes had higher specificity (e.g., code 
      present in problem list, 94%). Differences were observed using time-based 
      criteria (e.g., days between visit diagnoses) and between participating 
      hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Consistency between manually-collected registry data and 
      CDM-based phenotypes for history of HF was high overall, but use of different 
      phenotypes impacted sensitivity and specificity, and results may differ depending 
      on the medical condition of interest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The supplementation of electronic health records data with 
      administrative claims data may be used to capture outcome events more 
      comprehensively in longitudinal observational studies. This study investigated 
      the utility of administrative claims data to identify outcomes across health 
      systems using a comparative effectiveness study of different types of bariatric 
      surgery as a model. METHODS: This observational cohort study identified patients 
      who had bariatric surgery between 2007 and 2015 within the HealthCore Anthem 
      Research Network (HCARN) database in the National Patient-Centered Clinical 
      Research Network (PCORnet) common data model. Patients whose procedures were 
      performed in a member facility affiliated with PCORnet Clinical Research Networks 
      (CRNs) were selected. The outcomes included a 30-day composite adverse event 
      (including venous thromboembolism, percutaneous/operative intervention, failure 
      to discharge and death), and all-cause hospitalization, abdominal operation or 
      intervention, and in-hospital death up to 5 years after the procedure. Outcomes 
      were classified as occurring within or outside PCORnet CRN health systems using 
      facility identifiers. RESULTS: We identified 4899 patients who had bariatric 
      surgery in one of the PCORnet CRN health systems. For 30-day composite adverse 
      event, the inclusion of HCARN multi-site claims data marginally increased the 
      incidence rate based only on HCARN single-site claims data for PCORnet CRNs from 
      3.9 to 4.2%. During the 5-year follow-up period, 56.8% of all-cause 
      hospitalizations, 31.2% abdominal operations or interventions, and 32.3% of 
      in-hospital deaths occurred outside PCORnet CRNs. Incidence rates (events per 100 
      patient-years) were significantly lower when based on claims from a single 
      PCORnet CRN only compared to using claims from all health systems in the HCARN: 
      all-cause hospitalization, 11.0 (95% Confidence Internal [CI]: 10.4, 11.6) to 
      25.3 (95% CI: 24.4, 26.3); abdominal operations or interventions, 4.2 (95% CI: 
      3.9, 4.6) to 6.1 (95% CI: 5.7, 6.6); in-hospital death, 0.2 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.27) 
      to 0.3 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term inclusion of multi-site 
      claims data only marginally increased the incidence rate computed from 
      single-site claims data alone. Longer-term follow up captured a notable number of 
      events outside of PCORnet CRNs. The findings suggest that supplementing claims 
      data improves the outcome ascertainment in longitudinal observational comparative 
      effectiveness studies.

TI  - Clinical encounter heterogeneity and methods for resolving in networked EHR data: 
      a study from N3C and RECOVER programs.
PG  - 1125-1136
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocad057 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical encounter data are heterogeneous and vary greatly from 
      institution to institution. These problems of variance affect interpretability 
      and usability of clinical encounter data for analysis. These problems are 
      magnified when multisite electronic health record (EHR) data are networked 
      together. This article presents a novel, generalizable method for resolving 
      encounter heterogeneity for analysis by combining related atomic encounters into 
      composite "macrovisits." MATERIALS AND METHODS: Encounters were composed of data 
      from 75 partner sites harmonized to a common data model as part of the NIH 
      Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, a project of the National Covid 
      Cohort Collaborative. Summary statistics were computed for overall and site-level 
      data to assess issues and identify modifications. Two algorithms were developed 
      to refine atomic encounters into cleaner, analyzable longitudinal clinical 
      visits. RESULTS: Atomic inpatient encounters data were found to be widely 
      disparate between sites in terms of length-of-stay (LOS) and numbers of OMOP CDM 
      measurements per encounter. After aggregating encounters to macrovisits, LOS and 
      measurement variance decreased. A subsequent algorithm to identify hospitalized 
      macrovisits further reduced data variability. DISCUSSION: Encounters are a 
      complex and heterogeneous component of EHR data and native data issues are not 
      addressed by existing methods. These types of complex and poorly studied issues 
      contribute to the difficulty of deriving value from EHR data, and these types of 
      foundational, large-scale explorations, and developments are necessary to realize 
      the full potential of modern real-world data. CONCLUSION: This article presents 
      method developments to manipulate and resolve EHR encounter data issues in a 
      generalizable way as a foundation for future research and analysis.

TI  - Multi-Institutional Collaborative Research Using Ophthalmic Medical Image Data 
      Standardized by Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM).
PG  - 48-52
LID - 10.3233/SHTI230925 [doi]
AB  - Observational Medical Outcome Partners - Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) is an 
      international standard model for standardizing electronic medical record data. 
      However, unstructured data such as medical image data which is beyond the scope 
      of standardization by the current OMOP-CDM is difficult to be used in 
      multi-institutional collaborative research. Therefore, we developed the 
      Radiology-CDM (R-CDM) which standardizes medical imaging data. As a proof of 
      concept, 737,500 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data from two tertiary 
      hospitals in South Korea is standardized in the form of R-CDM. The relationship 
      between chronic disease and retinal thickness was analyzed by using the R-CDM. 
      Central macular thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were 
      significantly thinner in the patients with hypertension compared to the control 
      cohort. It is meaningful in that multi-institutional collaborative research using 
      medical image data and clinical data simultaneously can be conducted very 
      efficiently.

TI  - Transforming French Electronic Health Records into the Observational Medical 
      Outcome Partnership's Common Data Model: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 13-22
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-3402754 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Common data models (CDMs) enable data to be standardized, and 
      facilitate data exchange, sharing, and storage, particularly when the data have 
      been collected via distinct, heterogeneous systems. Moreover, CDMs provide tools 
      for data quality assessment, integration into models, visualization, and 
      analysis. The observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) provides a CDM for 
      organizing and standardizing databases. Common data models not only facilitate 
      data integration but also (and especially for the OMOP model) extends the range 
      of available statistical analyses. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the 
      feasibility of implementing French national electronic health records in the OMOP 
      CDM. METHODS: The OMOP's specifications were used to audit the source data, 
      specify the transformation into the OMOP CDM, implement an extract-transform-load 
      process to feed data from the French health care system into the OMOP CDM, and 
      evaluate the final database. RESULTS: Seventeen vocabularies corresponding to the 
      French context were added to the OMOP CDM's concepts. Three French terminologies 
      were automatically mapped to standardized vocabularies. We loaded nine tables 
      from the OMOP CDM's "standardized clinical data" section, and three tables from 
      the "standardized health system data" section. Outpatient and inpatient data from 
      38,730 individuals were integrated. The median (interquartile range) number of 
      outpatient and inpatient stays per patient was 160 (19-364). CONCLUSION: Our 
      results demonstrated that data from the French national health care system can be 
      integrated into the OMOP CDM. One of the main challenges was the use of 
      international OMOP concepts to annotate data recorded in a French context. The 
      use of local terminologies was an obstacle to conceptual mapping; with the 
      exception of an adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases 10th 
      Revision, the French health care system does not use international terminologies. 
      It would be interesting to extend our present findings to the 65 million people 
      registered in the French health care system.

TI  - The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network Antibiotics and Childhood Growth 
      Study: Implementing Patient Data Linkage.
PG  - 438-444
LID - 10.1089/pop.2019.0089 [doi]
AB  - PCORnet, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network, is comprised of health 
      systems and health plans that transform electronic health records (EHRs) and 
      claims data to a common data model (CDM) to facilitate real-world clinical 
      research. Because patients receive health care in multiple care delivery 
      settings, linking health records across systems and health plan claims would 
      provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of health care for patients. 
      The current study expanded on a PCORnet Antibiotics and Childhood Growth (ABX) 
      study to (1) identify and implement a privacy-preserving patient linkage solution 
      among a clinical data research network and a health plan network within the ABX 
      Study, and (2) assess overlap in prescribed and dispensed antibiotics and 
      additional data gained from claims among the linked patients. This manuscript 
      describes the linkage process and resulting overlap analysis. The authors 
      identified 549 patients from the EHR record study cohort who had claims records 
      with the health plan. Sixty percent (n = 329) of patients had consistent 
      antibiotic exposure data across the 2 sources, indicating antibiotic exposure 
      (44.3%) or nonexposure (15.7%). Among total antibiotic prescribing records, 43.1% 
      had a matched claims record for dispensing within 60 days. Among antibiotic 
      dispense records 26.5% were not associated with a prescribing record in the 
      linked health systems. These findings showcase the feasibility of linking health 
      plan claims data to PCORnet CDM in a privacy-preserving manner while also 
      demonstrating continued gaps in data that may occur. The study highlights the 
      importance of combining multiple health data sources for comprehensive clinical 
      research.

TI  - COVID-19 SignSym: a fast adaptation of a general clinical NLP tool to identify 
      and normalize COVID-19 signs and symptoms to OMOP common data model.
PG  - 1275-1283
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab015 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly, infecting millions of 
      people. An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical 
      concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be 
      valuable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims 
      at adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly build 
      COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8 
      attributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition, 
      uncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted information 
      is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep learning-based 
      models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to quickly build 
      the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our extensive 
      evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19 patients, as 
      well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19 SignSym can 
      achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used for this study 
      can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical natural language 
      processing tools need to be customized for specific information needs within a 
      short time. COVID-19 SignSym is freely accessible to the research community as a 
      downloadable package (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php) and has been used by 
      16 healthcare organizations to support clinical research of COVID-19.

TI  - Transformation of Pathology Reports Into the Common Data Model With Oncology 
      Module: Use Case for Colon Cancer.
PG  - e18526
LID - 10.2196/18526 [doi]
LID - e18526
AB  - BACKGROUND: Common data models (CDMs) help standardize electronic health record 
      data and facilitate outcome analysis for observational and longitudinal research. 
      An analysis of pathology reports is required to establish fundamental information 
      infrastructure for data-driven colon cancer research. The Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is used in distributed research networks for 
      clinical data; however, it requires conversion of free text-based pathology 
      reports into the CDM's format. There are few use cases of representing cancer 
      data in CDM. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to construct a CDM database of 
      colon cancer-related pathology with natural language processing (NLP) for a 
      research platform that can utilize both clinical and omics data. The essential 
      text entities from the pathology reports are extracted, standardized, and 
      converted to the OMOP CDM format in order to utilize the pathology data in cancer 
      research. METHODS: We extracted clinical text entities, mapped them to the 
      standard concepts in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics 
      vocabularies, and built databases and defined relations for the CDM tables. Major 
      clinical entities were extracted through NLP on pathology reports of surgical 
      specimens, immunohistochemical studies, and molecular studies of colon cancer 
      patients at a tertiary general hospital in South Korea. Items were extracted from 
      each report using regular expressions in Python. Unstructured data, such as text 
      that does not have a pattern, were handled with expert advice by adding regular 
      expression rules. Our own dictionary was used for normalization and 
      standardization to deal with biomarker and gene names and other ungrammatical 
      expressions. The extracted clinical and genetic information was mapped to the 
      Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes databases and the Systematized 
      Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) standard terminologies recommended by the OMOP 
      CDM. The database-table relationships were newly defined through SNOMED standard 
      terminology concepts. The standardized data were inserted into the CDM tables. 
      For evaluation, 100 reports were randomly selected and independently annotated by 
      a medical informatics expert and a nurse. RESULTS: We examined and standardized 
      1848 immunohistochemical study reports, 3890 molecular study reports, and 12,352 
      pathology reports of surgical specimens (from 2017 to 2018). The constructed and 
      updated database contained the following extracted colorectal entities: (1) 
      NOTE_NLP, (2) MEASUREMENT, (3) CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, (4) SPECIMEN, and (5) 
      FACT_RELATIONSHIP of specimen with condition and measurement. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study aimed to prepare CDM data for a research platform to take advantage of all 
      omics clinical and patient data at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for 
      colon cancer pathology. A more sophisticated preparation of the pathology data is 
      needed for further research on cancer genomics, and various types of text 
      narratives are the next target for additional research on the use of data in the 
      CDM.

AB  - Computerized clinical guidelines (CCG) are effective instruments for 
      standardizing, monitoring and optimizing medical treatment processes. 
      Nevertheless, due to barriers in flexibility, transferability and acceptance, the 
      widespread use of CCG in clinical practice is not yet common. To overcome those 
      issues, we present a concept on how to use real world data to evaluate CCG and to 
      recommend improvements. As a first result, we defined an algorithm to extract 
      treatment processes based on the standardized Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model as well as their visualization using the 
      graphical modeling language Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN).

TI  - Tracking Blood Pressure Control Performance and Process Metrics in 25 US Health 
      Systems: The PCORnet Blood Pressure Control Laboratory.

AB  - Background The National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network Blood Pressure 
      Control Laboratory Surveillance System was established to identify opportunities 
      for blood pressure (BP) control improvement and to provide a mechanism for 
      tracking improvement longitudinally. Methods and Results We conducted a serial 
      cross-sectional study with queries against standardized electronic health record 
      data in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) common 
      data model returned by 25 participating US health systems. Queries produced BP 
      control metrics for adults with well-documented hypertension and a recent 
      encounter at the health system for a series of 1-year measurement periods for 
      each quarter of available data from January 2017 to March 2020. Aggregate 
      weighted results are presented overall and by race and ethnicity. The most recent 
      measurement period includes data from 1 737 995 patients, and 11 956 509 
      patient-years were included in the trend analysis. Overall, 15% were Black, 52% 
      women, and 28% had diabetes. BP control (<140/90 mm Hg) was observed in 62% 
      (range, 44%-74%) but varied by race and ethnicity, with the lowest BP control 
      among Black patients at 57% (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.94). A new class of 
      antihypertensive medication (medication intensification) was prescribed in just 
      12% (range, 0.6%-25%) of patient visits where BP was uncontrolled. However, when 
      medication intensification occurred, there was a large decrease in systolic BP 
      (≈15 mm Hg; range, 5-18 mm Hg). Conclusions Major opportunities exist for 
      improving BP control and reducing disparities, especially through consistent 
      medication intensification when BP is uncontrolled. These data demonstrate 
      substantial room for improvement and opportunities to close health equity gaps.

PG  - 1303-1306
LID - 10.1002/pds.5025 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To present the process of establishing a pharmacoepidemiological 
      database in Saudi Arabia, challenges and models used. METHODS: The database 
      establishment has started in 2017 by piloting the conversion of electronic health 
      records of one hospital to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics 
      (OHDSI), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership's Common Data Model (OMOP). 
      RESULTS: During the pilot phase we have faced several challenges such as limited 
      contribution in providing data by local medical institution due to uncertainty 
      about data governance, diversity of systems used by hospitals, inconsistent 
      coding of medical information, and limited awareness about data structure from 
      participating hospital. The pilot phase was completed in 2019 containing 
      information about patient attributes, medical care, therapies, and other 
      additional services for around 130 000 patients in Saudi Arabia. The majority of 
      patients were below the age of 50 years (89%), and acute respiratory infections 
      were the most frequent diagnosis. The data quality was acceptable and no major 
      anomalies were detected during the conversion. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a 
      successful creation of a pilot database using OHDSI Common Data Model. Our 
      experience with the pilot database could be extended to other institutions to 
      create a national dataset that could be used to generate real-world evidence.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership and 
      Mini-Sentinel Common Data Models and Analytics: Implications for Active Drug 
      Safety Surveillance.
PG  - 749-65
LID - 10.1007/s40264-015-0297-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An often key component to coordinating surveillance activities 
      across distributed networks is the design and implementation of a common data 
      model (CDM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate two drug safety 
      surveillance CDMs from an ecosystem perspective to better understand how 
      differences in CDMs and analytic tools affect usability and interpretation of 
      results. METHODS: Humana claims data from 2007 to 2012 were mapped to 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and Mini-Sentinel CDMs. Data 
      were described and compared at the patient level by source code and mapped 
      concepts. Study cohort construction and effect estimates were also compared using 
      two different analytical methods--one based on a new user design implementing a 
      high-dimensional propensity score (HDPS) algorithm and the other based on 
      univariate self-controlled case series (SCCS) design--across six established 
      positive drug-outcome pairs to learn how differences in CDMs and analytics 
      influence steps in the database analytic process and results. RESULTS: Claims 
      data for approximately 7.7 million Humana health plan members were transformed 
      into the two CDMs. Three health outcome cohorts and two drug cohorts showed 
      differences in cohort size and constituency between Mini-Sentinel and OMOP CDMs, 
      which was a result of multiple factors. Overall, the implementation of the HDPS 
      procedure on Mini-Sentinel CDM detected more known positive associations than 
      that on OMOP CDM. The SCCS method results were comparable on both CDMs. 
      Differences in the implementation of the HDPS procedure between the two CDMs were 
      identified; analytic model and risk period specification had a significant impact 
      on the performance of the HDPS procedure on OMOP CDM. CONCLUSIONS: Differences 
      were observed between OMOP and Mini-Sentinel CDMs. The analysis of both CDMs at 
      the data model level indicated that such conceptual differences had only a slight 
      but not significant impact on identifying known safety associations. Our results 
      show that differences at the ecosystem level of analyses across the CDMs can lead 
      to strikingly different risk estimations, but this can be primarily attributed to 
      the choices of analytic approach and their implementation in the 
      community-developed analytic tools. The opportunities of using CDMs are clear, 
      but our study shows the need for judicious comparison of analyses across the 
      CDMs. Our work emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts to ensure sustainable 
      transparent platforms to maintain and develop CDMs and associated tools for 
      effective safety surveillance.

      OMOP-CDM Ontology Model.
PG  - 1427-1431
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240680 [doi]
AB  - The task of managing diverse electronic health records requires the consolidation 
      of data from different sources to facilitate clinical research and 
      decision-making support, with the emergence of the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership - Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) as a standard relational database 
      schema for structuring health records from different sources. Working with 
      ontologies is strongly associated with reasoners. Implementing them over 
      expansive and intricate Ontologies can pose computational challenges, potentially 
      resulting in slow performance. In this paper, we propose the implementation of a 
      new reasoner based on categorical logic over a translation of OMOP-CDM into an 
      ontology model. This enables enhancements to the efficiency and scalability of 
      implementing such models.

PG  - 263-267
AB  - Diabetes is one of the major burdens in health care, but could be controlled if 
      the relevant data are well-managed. Referring to current successful cases, we 
      designed a framework for the interoperability and integration of medical data in 
      compliance with both archetype and reference information model specification. The 
      clinical data model (CDM) was designed on the basis of OpenEHR archetypes and 
      self-made patient generated health data (PGHD). Integrating healthcare enterprise 
      (IHE) protocol was taken into integrating different modality data. After 
      terminology mapping, the personal health record could be transferred and shared 
      in different clinical information vendors complying with HL7 standards. Many 
      fragment data such as blood glucose and gene data were also integrated to system. 
      Those patients suspected of higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) were grouped 
      as case and other patients could be filtered as control cohort. Furthermore, the 
      framework could be further developed for precision medicine.

TI  - Learning debiased graph representations from the OMOP common data model for 
      synthetic data generation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generating synthetic patient data is crucial for medical research, 
      but common approaches build up on black-box models which do not allow for expert 
      verification or intervention. We propose a highly available method which enables 
      synthetic data generation from real patient records in a privacy preserving and 
      compliant fashion, is interpretable and allows for expert intervention. METHODS: 
      Our approach ties together two established tools in medical informatics, namely 
      OMOP as a data standard for electronic health records and Synthea as a data 
      synthetization method. For this study, data pipelines were built which extract 
      data from OMOP, convert them into time series format, learn temporal rules by 2 
      statistical algorithms (Markov chain, TARM) and 3 algorithms of causal discovery 
      (DYNOTEARS, J-PCMCI+, LiNGAM) and map the outputs into Synthea graphs. The graphs 
      are evaluated quantitatively by their individual and relative complexity and 
      qualitatively by medical experts. RESULTS: The algorithms were found to learn 
      qualitatively and quantitatively different graph representations. Whereas the 
      Markov chain results in extremely large graphs, TARM, DYNOTEARS, and J-PCMCI+ 
      were found to reduce the data dimension during learning. The MultiGroupDirect 
      LiNGAM algorithm was found to not be applicable to the problem statement at hand. 
      CONCLUSION: Only TARM and DYNOTEARS are practical algorithms for real-world data 
      in this use case. As causal discovery is a method to debias purely statistical 
      relationships, the gradient-based causal discovery algorithm DYNOTEARS was found 
      to be most suitable.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe application of the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to support medical 
      device real-world evaluation in a National Evaluation System for health 
      Technology Coordinating Center (NESTcc) Test-Case involving 2 healthcare systems, 
      Mercy Health and Mayo Clinic. CDM implementation was coordinated across 2 
      healthcare systems with multiple hospitals to aggregate both medical device data 
      from supply chain databases and patient outcomes and covariates from electronic 
      health record data. Several data quality assurance (QA) analyses were implemented 
      on the OMOP CDM to validate the data extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) 
      process. OMOP CDM-based data of relevant patient encounters were successfully 
      established to support studies for FDA regulatory submissions. QA analyses 
      verified that the data transformation was robust between data sources and OMOP 
      CDM. Our efforts provided useful insights in real-world data integration using 
      OMOP CDM for medical device evaluation coordinated across multiple healthcare 
      systems.

TI  - Characterization of Anti-seizure Medication Treatment Pathways in Pediatric 
      Epilepsy Using the Electronic Health Record-Based Common Data Model.
PG  - 409

AB  - The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze treatment pathways of pediatric 
      epilepsy using the common data model (CDM) based on electronic health record 
      (EHR) data. We also aimed to reveal whether CDM analysis was feasible and 
      applicable to epilepsy research. We analyzed the treatment pathways of pediatric 
      epilepsy patients from our institute who underwent antiseizure medication (ASM) 
      treatment for at least 2 years, using the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP)-CDM. Subgroup analysis was performed for generalized or focal 
      epilepsy, varying age of epilepsy onset, and specific epilepsy syndromes. Changes 
      in annual prescription patterns were also analyzed to reveal the different 
      trends. We also calculated the proportion of drug-resistant epilepsy by applying 
      the definition of seizure persistence after application of two ASMs for a 
      sufficient period of time (more than 6 months). We identified 1,192 patients who 
      underwent treatment for more than 2 years (mean ± standard deviation: 6.5 ± 3.2 
      years). In our pediatric epilepsy cohort, we identified 313 different treatment 
      pathways. Drug resistance, calculated as the application of more than three ASMs 
      during the first 2 years of treatment, was 23.8%. Treatment pathways and ASM 
      resistance differed between subgroups of generalized vs. focal epilepsy, 
      different onset age of epilepsy, and specific epilepsy syndromes. The frequency 
      of ASM prescription was similar between onset groups of different ages; however, 
      phenobarbital was frequently used in children with epilepsy onset < 4 years. 
      Ninety-one of 344 cases of generalized epilepsy and 187 of 835 cases of focal 
      epilepsy were classified as medically intractable epilepsy. The percentage of 
      drug resistance was markedly different depending on the specific electro-clinical 
      epilepsy syndrome [79.0% for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), 7.1% for childhood 
      absence epilepsy (CAE), and 9.0% for benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes 
      (BECTS)]. We could visualize the annual trend and changes of ASM prescription for 
      pediatric epilepsy in our institute from 2004 to 2017. We revealed that CDM 
      analysis was feasible and applicable for epilepsy research. The strengths and 
      limitations of CDM analysis should be carefully considered when planning the 
      analysis, result extraction, and interpretation of results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The content of the clinical notes that have been continuously 
      collected along patients' health history has the potential to provide relevant 
      information about treatments and diseases, and to increase the value of 
      structured data available in Electronic Health Records (EHR) databases. EHR 
      databases are currently being used in observational studies which lead to 
      important findings in medical and biomedical sciences. However, the information 
      present in clinical notes is not being used in those studies, since the 
      computational analysis of this unstructured data is much complex in comparison to 
      structured data. METHODS: We propose a two-stage workflow for solving an existing 
      gap in Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) procedures regarding 
      observational databases. The first stage of the workflow extracts prescriptions 
      present in patient's clinical notes, while the second stage harmonises the 
      extracted information into their standard definition and stores the resulting 
      information in a common database schema used in observational studies. RESULTS: 
      We validated this methodology using two distinct data sets, in which the goal was 
      to extract and store drug related information in a new Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) database. We analysed the 
      performance of the used annotator as well as its limitations. Finally, we 
      described some practical examples of how users can explore these datasets once 
      migrated to OMOP CDM databases. CONCLUSION: With this methodology, we were able 
      to show a strategy for using the information extracted from the clinical notes in 
      business intelligence tools, or for other applications such as data exploration 
      through the use of SQL queries. Besides, the extracted information complements 
      the data present in OMOP CDM databases which was not directly available in the 
      EHR database.

LID - ooab028
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Feature engineering is a major bottleneck in phenotyping. Properly 
      learned medical concept embeddings (MCEs) capture the semantics of medical 
      concepts, thus are useful for retrieving relevant medical features in phenotyping 
      tasks. We compared the effectiveness of MCEs learned from knowledge graphs and 
      electronic healthcare records (EHR) data in retrieving relevant medical features 
      for phenotyping tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented 5 embedding methods 
      including node2vec, singular value decomposition (SVD), LINE, skip-gram, and 
      GloVe with 2 data sources: (1) knowledge graphs obtained from the observational 
      medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data model; and (2) patient-level data 
      obtained from the OMOP compatible electronic health records (EHR) from Columbia 
      University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). We used phenotypes with their relevant 
      concepts developed and validated by the electronic medical records and genomics 
      (eMERGE) network to evaluate the performance of learned MCEs in retrieving 
      phenotype-relevant concepts. Hits@k% in retrieving phenotype-relevant concepts 
      based on a single and multiple seed concept(s) was used to evaluate MCEs. 
      RESULTS: Among all MCEs, MCEs learned by using node2vec with knowledge graphs 
      showed the best performance. Of MCEs based on knowledge graphs and EHR data, MCEs 
      learned by using node2vec with knowledge graphs and MCEs learned by using GloVe 
      with EHR data outperforms other MCEs, respectively. CONCLUSION: MCE enables 
      scalable feature engineering tasks, thereby facilitating phenotyping. Based on 
      current phenotyping practices, MCEs learned by using knowledge graphs constructed 
      by hierarchical relationships among medical concepts outperformed MCEs learned by 
      using EHR data.

TI  - PatientExploreR: an extensible application for dynamic visualization of patient 
      clinical history from electronic health records in the OMOP common data model.
PG  - 4515-4518
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz409 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Electronic health records (EHRs) are quickly becoming omnipresent in 
      healthcare, but interoperability issues and technical demands limit their use for 
      biomedical and clinical research. Interactive and flexible software that 
      interfaces directly with EHR data structured around a common data model (CDM) 
      could accelerate more EHR-based research by making the data more accessible to 
      researchers who lack computational expertise and/or domain knowledge. RESULTS: We 
      present PatientExploreR, an extensible application built on the R/Shiny framework 
      that interfaces with a relational database of EHR data in the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership CDM format. PatientExploreR produces patient-level 
      interactive and dynamic reports and facilitates visualization of clinical data 
      without any programming required. It allows researchers to easily construct and 
      export patient cohorts from the EHR for analysis with other software. This 
      application could enable easier exploration of patient-level data for physicians 
      and researchers. PatientExploreR can incorporate EHR data from any institution 
      that employs the CDM for users with approved access. The software code is free 
      and open source under the MIT license, enabling institutions to install and users 
      to expand and modify the application for their own purposes. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: PatientExploreR can be freely obtained from GitHub: 
      https://github.com/BenGlicksberg/PatientExploreR. We provide instructions for how 
      researchers with approved access to their institutional EHR can use this package. 
      We also release an open sandbox server of synthesized patient data for users 
      without EHR access to explore: http://patientexplorer.ucsf.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY 
      INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Incrementally Transforming Electronic Medical Records into the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model: A Multidimensional Quality 
      Assurance Approach.
PG  - 794-803
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1697598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development and adoption of health care common data models (CDMs) 
      has addressed some of the logistical challenges of performing research on data 
      generated from disparate health care systems by standardizing data 
      representations and leveraging standardized terminology to express clinical 
      information consistently. However, transforming a data system into a CDM is not a 
      trivial task, and maintaining an operational, enterprise capable CDM that is 
      incrementally updated within a data warehouse is challenging. OBJECTIVES: To 
      develop a quality assurance (QA) process and code base to accompany our 
      incremental transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data 
      Warehouse health care database into the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) CDM to prevent incremental load errors. METHODS: We designed 
      and implemented a multistage QA) approach centered on completeness, value 
      conformance, and relational conformance data-quality elements. For each element 
      we describe key incremental load challenges, our extract, transform, and load 
      (ETL) solution of data to overcome those challenges, and potential impacts of 
      incremental load failure. RESULTS: Completeness and value conformance 
      data-quality elements are most affected by incremental changes to the CDW, while 
      updates to source identifiers impact relational conformance. ETL failures 
      surrounding these elements lead to incomplete and inaccurate capture of clinical 
      concepts as well as data fragmentation across patients, providers, and locations. 
      CONCLUSION: Development of robust QA processes supporting accurate transformation 
      of OMOP and other CDMs from source data is still in evolution, and opportunities 
      exist to extend the existing QA framework and tools used for incremental ETL QA 
      processes.

PG  - 711-712
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240292 [doi]
AB  - Common data models provide a standardized way to represent data used in federated 
      learning tasks. The aim of this review was to explore the development and use of 
      common data models to harmonize electronic health record data in health research. 
      The data search yielded 724 records, of which 19 were included for this study. 
      None of the research focused on nursing specific topics. All studies either 
      utilized the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model, 
      or developed a model partly based on the OMOP. A roadmap to guide research for 
      the development of common data models for federated learning are warranted.

TI  - Harmonizing units and values of quantitative data elements in a very large 
      nationally pooled electronic health record (EHR) dataset.
PG  - 1172-1182
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocac054 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to harmonize data from electronic health 
      records (EHRs) into common units, and impute units that were missing. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) table of laboratory 
      measurement data-over 3.1 billion patient records and over 19 000 unique 
      measurement concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) 
      common-data-model format from 55 data partners. We grouped ontologically similar 
      OMOP concepts together for 52 variables relevant to COVID-19 research, and 
      developed a unit-harmonization pipeline comprised of (1) selecting a canonical 
      unit for each measurement variable, (2) arriving at a formula for conversion, (3) 
      obtaining clinical review of each formula, (4) applying the formula to convert 
      data values in each unit into the target canonical unit, and (5) removing any 
      harmonized value that fell outside of accepted value ranges for the variable. For 
      data with missing units for all the results within a lab test for a data partner, 
      we compared values with pooled values of all data partners, using the 
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. RESULTS: Of the concepts without missing values, we 
      harmonized 88.1% of the values, and imputed units for 78.2% of records where 
      units were absent (41% of contributors' records lacked units). DISCUSSION: The 
      harmonization and inference methods developed herein can serve as a resource for 
      initiatives aiming to extract insight from heterogeneous EHR collections. Unique 
      properties of centralized data are harnessed to enable unit inference. 
      CONCLUSION: The pipeline we developed for the pooled N3C data enables use of 
      measurements that would otherwise be unavailable for analysis.

TI  - Transforming the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) in 
      Catalonia to the OMOP Common Data Model and Its Use for COVID-19 Research.
PG  - 969-986
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S419481 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The primary aim of this work was to convert the Information System for 
      Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) from Catalonia, Spain, to the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). Our second aim was 
      to provide a descriptive analysis of COVID-19-related outcomes among the general 
      population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We mapped patient-level data from SIDIAP to the 
      OMOP CDM and we performed more than 3,400 data quality checks to assess its 
      readiness for research. We established a general population cohort as of the 1st 
      March 2020 and identified outpatient COVID-19 diagnoses or tested positive for, 
      hospitalised with, admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with, died with, or 
      vaccinated against COVID-19 up to 30th June 2022. RESULTS: After verifying the 
      high quality of the transformed dataset, we included 5,870,274 individuals in the 
      general population cohort. Of those, 604,472 had either an outpatient COVID-19 
      diagnosis or positive test result, 58,991 had a hospitalisation, 5,642 had an ICU 
      admission, and 11,233 died with COVID-19. A total of 4,584,515 received a 
      COVID-19 vaccine. People who were hospitalised or died were more commonly older, 
      male, and with more comorbidities. Those admitted to ICU with COVID-19 were 
      generally younger and more often male than those hospitalised and those who died. 
      CONCLUSION: We successfully transformed SIDIAP to the OMOP CDM. From this 
      dataset, a general population cohort of 5.9 million individuals was identified 
      and their COVID-19-related outcomes over time were described. The transformed 
      SIDIAP database is a valuable resource that can enable distributed network 
      research in COVID-19 and beyond.

TI  - OMOP-on-FHIR: A FHIR Server Development to Facilitate Data Interaction with the 
      OMOP-CDM and FHIR for PGHD.
PG  - 157-158
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240367 [doi]
AB  - This paper introduces the concept of the implementation of a FHIR server for 
      bidirectional data exchange with the OMOP-CDM. Leveraging FHIR as a metamodel, 
      the implementation aims to promote a more interconnected and patient-centric 
      healthcare ecosystem. The methodology involves utilizing the Java HAPI FHIR API 
      for server architecture and validating the solution through patient data exchange 
      with a FHIR reference implementation server. This initiative signifies a 
      significant advancement in healthcare data interoperability, promising improved 
      patient care quality and clinical research vigor.

TI  - Association between dyslipidemia and asthma in children: a systematic review and 
      multicenter cohort study using a common data model.
PG  - 357-365
LID - 10.3345/cep.2023.00290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between dyslipidemia and asthma in children remains 
      unclear. PURPOSE: This study investigated the association between dyslipidemia 
      and cholesterol levels in children. METHODS: A systematic literature review was 
      performed to identify studies investigating the association between dyslipidemia 
      and asthma in children. The PubMed database was searched for articles published 
      from January 2000-March 2022. Data from a cohort study using electronic health 
      records from 5 hospitals, converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), were used to identify the association 
      between total cholesterol (TC) levels and asthma in children. This cohort study 
      used the Cox proportional hazards model to examine hazard ratio (HR) of asthma 
      after propensity score matching, and included an aggregate meta-analysis of HR. 
      RESULTS: We examined 11 studies reporting an association between dyslipidemia and 
      asthma in children. Most were cross-sectional; however, their results were 
      inconsistent. In OMOP-CDM multicenter analysis, the high TC (>170 mg/dL) group 
      included 29,038 children, while the normal TC (≤170 mg/dL) group included 88,823 
      children including all hospital datasets. In a meta-analysis of this multicenter 
      cohort, a significant association was found between high TC levels and later 
      development of asthma in children <15 years of age (pooled HR, 1.30; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.12-1.52). CONCLUSION: Elevated TC levels in children may 
      be associated with asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data 
      Model (CDM) has been implemented on various claims and electronic health record 
      (EHR) databases, but has not been applied to a hospital transactional database. 
      This study addresses the implementation of the OMOP CDM on the U.S. Premier 
      Hospital database. METHODS: We designed and implemented an extract, transform, 
      load (ETL) process to convert the Premier hospital database into the OMOP CDM. 
      Standard charge codes in Premier were mapped between the OMOP version 4.0 
      Vocabulary and standard charge descriptions. Visit logic was added to impute the 
      visit dates. We tested the conversion by replicating a published study using the 
      raw and transformed databases. The Premier hospital database was compared to a 
      claims database, in regard to prevalence of disease. FINDINGS: The data 
      transformed into the CDM resulted in 1% of the data being discarded due to data 
      errors in the raw data. A total of 91.4% of Premier standard charge codes were 
      mapped successfully to a standard vocabulary. The results of the replication 
      study resulted in a similar distribution of patient characteristics. The 
      comparison to the claims data yields notable similarities and differences amongst 
      conditions represented in both databases. DISCUSSION: The transformation of the 
      Premier database into the OMOP CDM version 4.0 adds value in conducting analyses 
      due to successful mapping of the drugs and procedures. The addition of visit 
      logic gives ordinality to drugs and procedures that wasn't present prior to the 
      transformation. Comparing conditions in Premier against a claims database can 
      provide an understanding about Premier's potential use in pharmacoepidemiology 
      studies that are traditionally conducted via claims databases. CONCLUSION AND 
      NEXT STEPS: The conversion of the Premier database into the OMOP CDM 4.0 was 
      completed successfully. The next steps include refinement of vocabularies and 
      mappings and continual maintenance of the transformed CDM.

AB  - This study developed readmission prediction models using Home Healthcare (HHC) 
      documents via natural language processing (NLP). An electronic health record of 
      Ajou University Hospital was used to develop prediction models (A reference model 
      using only structured data, and an NLP-enriched model with structured and 
      unstructured data). Among 573 patients, 63 were readmitted to the hospital. Five 
      topics were extracted from HHC documents and improved the model performance 
      (AUROC 0.740).

TI  - Automated Production of Research Data Marts from a Canonical Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Data Repository: Applications to COVID-19 
      Research.
LID - 2021.03.11.21253384 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2021.03.11.21253384 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the need for timely 
      real-world data (RWD) for research. To meet this need, several large clinical 
      consortia have developed networks for access to RWD from electronic health 
      records (EHR), each with its own common data model (CDM) and custom pipeline for 
      extraction, transformation, and load operations for production and incremental 
      updating. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely RWD (e.g., 2-week 
      delay) make this less feasible. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We describe the use of the 
      Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical model 
      for representation of clinical data for automated transformation to the 
      Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs and the near automated production of linked 
      clinical data repositories (CDRs) for COVID-19 research using the FHIR 
      subscription standard. The approach was applied to healthcare data from a large 
      academic institution and was evaluated using published quality assessment tools. 
      RESULTS: Six years of data (1.07M patients, 10.1M encounters, 137M laboratory 
      results), were loaded into the FHIR CDR producing 3 linked real-time linked 
      repositories: FHIR, PCORnet, and OMOP. PCORnet and OMOP databases were refined in 
      subsequent post processing steps into production releases and met published 
      quality standards. The approach greatly reduced CDM production efforts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: FHIR and FHIR CDRs can play an important role in enhancing the 
      availability of RWD from EHR systems. The above approach leverages 21 (st) 
      Century Cures Act mandated standards and could greatly enhance the availability 
      of datasets for research.

AB  - The emergence of collaborations, which standardize and combine multiple clinical 
      databases across different regions, provide a wealthy source of data, which is 
      fundamental for clinical prediction models, such as patient-level predictions. 
      With the aid of such large data pools, researchers are able to develop clinical 
      prediction models for improved disease classification, risk assessment, and 
      beyond. To fully utilize this potential, Machine Learning (ML) methods are 
      commonly required to process these large amounts of data on disease-specific 
      patient cohorts. As a consequence, the Observational Health Data Sciences and 
      Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative develops a framework to facilitate the 
      application of ML models for these standardized patient datasets by using the 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). In 
      this study, we compare the feasibility of current web-based OHDSI approaches, 
      namely ATLAS and "Patient-level Prediction" (PLP), against a native solution (R 
      based) to conduct such ML-based patient-level prediction analyses in OMOP. This 
      will enable potential users to select the most suitable approach for their 
      investigation. Each of the applied ML solutions was individually utilized to 
      solve the same patient-level prediction task. Both approaches went through an 
      exemplary benchmarking analysis to assess the weaknesses and strengths of the PLP 
      R-Package. In this work, the performance of this package was subsequently 
      compared versus the commonly used native R-package called Machine Learning in R 3 
      (mlr3), and its sub-packages. The approaches were evaluated on performance, 
      execution time, and ease of model implementation. The results show that the PLP 
      package has shorter execution times, which indicates great scalability, as well 
      as intuitive code implementation, and numerous possibilities for visualization. 
      However, limitations in comparison to native packages were depicted in the 
      implementation of specific ML classifiers (e.g., Lasso), which may result in a 
      decreased performance for real-world prediction problems. The findings here 
      contribute to the overall effort of developing ML-based prediction models on a 
      clinical scale and provide a snapshot for future studies that explicitly aim to 
      develop patient-level prediction models in OMOP CDM.

      record data using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data 
      Model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: More than one third of appropriately treated patients with epilepsy 
      have continued seizures despite two or more medication trials, meeting criteria 
      for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Accurate and reliable identification of 
      patients with DRE in observational data would enable large-scale, real-world 
      comparative effectiveness research and improve access to specialized epilepsy 
      care. In the present study, we aim to develop and compare the performance of 
      computable phenotypes for DRE using the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. METHODS: We randomly sampled 600 patients 
      from our academic medical center's electronic health record (EHR)-derived OMOP 
      database meeting previously validated criteria for epilepsy (January 2015-August 
      2021). Two reviewers manually classified patients as having DRE, drug-responsive 
      epilepsy, undefined drug responsiveness, or no epilepsy as of the last EHR 
      encounter in the study period based on consensus definitions. Demographic 
      characteristics and codes for diagnoses, antiseizure medications (ASMs), and 
      procedures were tested for association with DRE. Algorithms combining 
      permutations of these factors were applied to calculate sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for DRE. The 
      F1 score was used to compare overall performance. RESULTS: Among 412 patients 
      with source record-confirmed epilepsy, 62 (15.0%) had DRE, 163 (39.6%) had 
      drug-responsive epilepsy, 124 (30.0%) had undefined drug responsiveness, and 63 
      (15.3%) had insufficient records. The best performing phenotype for DRE in terms 
      of the F1 score was the presence of ≥1 intractable epilepsy code and ≥2 unique 
      non-gabapentinoid ASM exposures each with ≥90-day drug era (sensitivity = .661, 
      specificity = .937, PPV = .594, NPV = .952, F1 score = .626). Several phenotypes 
      achieved higher sensitivity at the expense of specificity and vice versa. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: OMOP algorithms can identify DRE in EHR-derived data with varying 
      tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. These computable phenotypes can be 
      applied across the largest international network of standardized clinical 
      databases for further validation, reproducible observational research, and 
      improving access to appropriate care.

TI  - Assessing the FAIRness of databases on the EHDEN portal: A case study on two 
      Dutch ICU databases.
PG  - 105104

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the growing need for effective data reuse in health 
      research, healthcare institutions need to make their data Findable, Accessible, 
      Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). A prevailing method to model databases for 
      interoperability is the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common 
      Data Model (CDM), developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and 
      Informatics (OHDSI) initiative. A European repository for OMOP CDM-converted 
      databases called the "European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) portal" was 
      developed, aiming to make these databases Findable and Accessible. This paper 
      aims to assess the FAIRness of databases on the EHDEN portal. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Two researchers involved in the OMOP CDM conversion of separate Dutch 
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) research databases each manually assessed their own 
      database using seventeen metrics. These were defined by the FAIRsFAIR project as 
      a list of minimum requirements for a database to be FAIR. Each metric is given a 
      score from zero to four based on how well the database adheres to the metric. The 
      maximum score for each metric varies from one to four based on the importance of 
      the metric. RESULTS: Fourteen out of the seventeen metrics were unanimously 
      rated: seven were rated the highest score, one was rated half of the highest 
      score, and five were rated the lowest score. The remaining three metrics were 
      assessed differently for the two use cases. The total scores achieved were 15.5 
      and 12 out of a maximum of 25. CONCLUSION: The main omissions in supporting 
      FAIRness were the lack of globally unique identifiers such as Uniform Resource 
      Identifiers (URIs) in the OMOP CDM and the lack of metadata standardization and 
      linkage in the EHDEN portal. By implementing these in future updates, the EHDEN 
      portal can be more FAIR.

PG  - 621-6
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002751 [doi]
AB  - This article describes the patient-centered Scalable National Network for 
      Effectiveness Research (pSCANNER), which is part of the recently formed PCORnet, 
      a national network composed of learning healthcare systems and patient-powered 
      research networks funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute 
      (PCORI). It is designed to be a stakeholder-governed federated network that uses 
      a distributed architecture to integrate data from three existing networks 
      covering over 21 million patients in all 50 states: (1) VA Informatics and 
      Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), with data from Veteran Health Administration's 
      151 inpatient and 909 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient clinics; (2) 
      the University of California Research exchange (UC-ReX) network, with data from 
      UC Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego; and (3) SCANNER, a 
      consortium of UCSD, Tennessee VA, and three federally qualified health systems in 
      the Los Angeles area supplemented with claims and health information exchange 
      data, led by the University of Southern California. Initial use cases will focus 
      on three conditions: (1) congestive heart failure; (2) Kawasaki disease; (3) 
      obesity. Stakeholders, such as patients, clinicians, and health service 
      researchers, will be engaged to prioritize research questions to be answered 
      through the network. We will use a privacy-preserving distributed computation 
      model with synchronous and asynchronous modes. The distributed system will be 
      based on a common data model that allows the construction and evaluation of 
      distributed multivariate models for a variety of statistical analyses.

TI  - Automated production of research data marts from a canonical fast healthcare 
      interoperability resource data repository: applications to COVID-19 research.
PG  - 1605-1611
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab108 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for timely 
      data from the healthcare systems for research. To meet this need, several large 
      new data consortia have been developed that require frequent updating and sharing 
      of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to 
      create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has 
      had a custom pipeline for extract, transform, and load operations for production 
      and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, 
      the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the 
      requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using 
      national data networks have increased. New approaches need to be developed to 
      address these demands. METHODS: In this article, we describe the use of the Fast 
      Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model 
      and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered 
      Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. 
      RESULTS: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP 
      CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and 
      postprocessing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data 
      developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act and could 
      greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research.

TI  - Predictors of diagnostic transition from major depressive disorder to bipolar 
      disorder: a retrospective observational network study.

AB  - Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are initially misdiagnosed with major 
      depressive disorder (MDD) and are treated with antidepressants, whose potential 
      iatrogenic effects are widely discussed. It is unknown whether MDD is a 
      comorbidity of BD or its earlier stage, and no consensus exists on individual 
      conversion predictors, delaying BD's timely recognition and treatment. We aimed 
      to build a predictive model of MDD to BD conversion and to validate it across a 
      multi-national network of patient databases using the standardization afforded by 
      the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Five 
      "training" US databases were retrospectively analyzed: IBM MarketScan CCAE, MDCR, 
      MDCD, Optum EHR, and Optum Claims. Cyclops regularized logistic regression models 
      were developed on one-year MDD-BD conversion with all standard covariates from 
      the HADES PatientLevelPrediction package. Time-to-conversion Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis was performed up to a decade after MDD, stratified by model-estimated 
      risk. External validation of the final prediction model was performed across 9 
      patient record databases within the Observational Health Data Sciences and 
      Informatics (OHDSI) network internationally. The model's area under the curve 
      (AUC) varied 0.633-0.745 (µ = 0.689) across the five US training databases. Nine 
      variables predicted one-year MDD-BD transition. Factors that increased risk were: 
      younger age, severe depression, psychosis, anxiety, substance misuse, self-harm 
      thoughts/actions, and prior mental disorder. AUCs of the validation datasets 
      ranged 0.570-0.785 (µ = 0.664). An assessment algorithm was built for MDD to BD 
      conversion that allows distinguishing as much as 100-fold risk differences among 
      patients and validates well across multiple international data sources.

TI  - Temporal Events Detector for Pregnancy Care (TED-PC): A rule-based algorithm to 
      infer gestational age and delivery date from electronic health records of 
      pregnant women with and without COVID-19.
PG  - e0276923

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identifying the time of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection relative to 
      specific gestational weeks is critical for delineating the role of viral 
      infection timing in adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, this task is difficult 
      when it comes to Electronic Health Records (EHR). In combating the COVID-19 
      pandemic for maternal health, we sought to develop and validate a clinical 
      information extraction algorithm to detect the time of clinical events relative 
      to gestational weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used EHR from the National COVID 
      Cohort Collaborative (N3C), in which the EHR are normalized by the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). We performed EHR 
      phenotyping, resulting in 270,897 pregnant women (June 1st, 2018 to May 31st, 
      2021). We developed a rule-based algorithm and performed a multi-level evaluation 
      to test content validity and clinical validity, and extreme length of gestation 
      (<150 or >300). RESULTS: The algorithm identified 296,194 pregnancies (16,659 
      COVID-19, 174,744 without COVID-19) in 270,897 pregnant women. For inferring 
      gestational age, 95% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high accuracy (Cohen's Kappa = 
      0.62); 100% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high granularity of temporal information 
      (Cohen's Kappa = 1). For inferring delivery dates, the accuracy is 100% (Cohen's 
      Kappa = 1). The accuracy of gestational age detection for the extreme length of 
      gestation is 93.3% (Cohen's Kappa = 1). Mothers with COVID-19 showed higher 
      prevalence in obesity or overweight (35.1% vs. 29.5%), diabetes (17.8% vs. 
      17.0%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.2% vs. 0.1%), respiratory 
      distress syndrome or acute respiratory failure (1.8% vs. 0.2%). DISCUSSION: We 
      explored the characteristics of pregnant women by different gestational weeks of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection with our algorithm. TED-PC is the first to infer the exact 
      gestational week linked with every clinical event from EHR and detect the timing 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The algorithm shows 
      excellent clinical validity in inferring gestational age and delivery dates, 
      which supports multiple EHR cohorts on N3C studying the impact of COVID-19 on 
      pregnancy.

TI  - Analysis of treatment pathways for three chronic diseases using OMOP CDM.

AB  - The present study examined treatment pathways (the ordered sequence of 
      medications that a patient is prescribed) for three chronic diseases 
      (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and depression), compared the pathways with 
      recommendations from guidelines, discussed differences and standardization of 
      medications in different medical institutions, explored population 
      diversification and changes of clinical treatment, and provided clinical big data 
      analysis-based data support for the development and study of drugs in China. In 
      order to run the "Treatment Pathways in Chronic Disease" protocol in Chinese data 
      sources,we have built a large data research and analysis platform for Chinese 
      clinical medical data. Data sourced from the Clinical Data Repository (CDR) of 
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University was extracted, 
      transformed, and loaded into an observational medical outcomes partnership common 
      data model (OMOP CDM) Ver. 5.0. Diagnosis and medication information for patients 
      with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and depression from 2005 to 2015 were 
      extracted for observational research to obtain treatment pathways for the three 
      diseases. The most common medications used to treat diabetes and hypertension 
      were metformin and acarbose, respectively, at 28.5 and 20.9% as first-line 
      medication. New drugs were emerging for depression; therefore, the favorite 
      medication changed accordingly. Most patients with these three diseases had 
      different treatment pathways from other patients with the same diseases. The 
      proportions of monotherapy increased for the three diseases, especially in recent 
      years. The recommendations presented in guidelines show some predominance. 
      High-quality, effective guidelines incorporating domestic facts should be 
      established to further guide medication and improve therapy at local hospitals. 
      Medical institutions at all levels could improve the quality of medical services, 
      and further standardize medications in the future. This research is the first 
      application of the CDM model and OHDSI software in China, which were used to 
      study, treatment pathways for three chronic diseases (hypertension, type 2 
      diabetes and depression), compare the pathways with recommendations from 
      guidelines, discuss differences and standardization of medications in different 
      medical institutions, demonstrate the urgent need for quality national 
      guidelines, explores population diversification and changes of clinical 
      treatment, and provide clinical big data analysis-based data support for the 
      development and study of drugs in China.

TI  - COVID-19 SignSym: a fast adaptation of a general clinical NLP tool to identify 
      and normalize COVID-19 signs and symptoms to OMOP common data model.
LID - arXiv:2007.10286v4
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly, infecting millions of 
      people. An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical 
      concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be 
      valuable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims 
      at adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly build 
      COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8 
      attributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition, 
      uncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted information 
      is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep learning-based 
      models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to quickly build 
      the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our extensive 
      evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19 patients, as 
      well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19 SignSym can 
      achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used for this study 
      can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical natural language 
      processing tools need to be customized for specific information needs within a 
      short time. COVID-19 SignSym is freely accessible to the research community as a 
      downloadable package (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php) and has been used by 
      16 healthcare organizations to support clinical research of COVID-19.

TI  - Mapping the Bulgarian Diabetes Register to OMOP CDM: Application Results.
PG  - 28-33
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Bulgaria Diabetes Register (BDR) contains more than 380 millions 
      of pseudonymized outpatient records with proprietary data structures and format. 
      OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the application results and experience acquired 
      during the process of mapping such observational health data to OMOP CDM with the 
      objective of publishing it in the European Health Data and Evidence Network 
      (EHDEN) Portal. METHODS: The data mapping follows the activities of the 
      well-structured Extract-Transform-Load process. Unlike other publications, we 
      focus on the need for preprocessing the data structures of raw data, cleaning 
      data and procedures for assuring quality of data. RESULTS: This paper provides 
      quantitative and statistical measures for the records in the CDM database as 
      published in the EHDEN Portal. CONCLUSION: The mapping of data from the BDR to 
      OMOP CDM provides the EHDEN community with opportunities for including these data 
      in large-scale project for evidence generation by applying standard analytical 
      tools.

TI  - Evaluation of Electronic Healthcare Databases for Post-Marketing Drug Safety 
      Surveillance and Pharmacoepidemiology in China.
PG  - 125-137
LID - 10.1007/s40264-017-0589-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Electronic healthcare databases (EHDs) are used increasingly for 
      post-marketing drug safety surveillance and pharmacoepidemiology in Europe and 
      North America. However, few studies have examined the potential of these data 
      sources in China. METHODS: Three major types of EHDs in China (i.e., a regional 
      community-based database, a national claims database, and an electronic medical 
      records [EMR] database) were selected for evaluation. Forty core variables were 
      derived based on the US Mini-Sentinel (MS) Common Data Model (CDM) as well as the 
      data features in China that would be desirable to support drug safety 
      surveillance. An email survey of these core variables and eight general questions 
      as well as follow-up inquiries on additional variables was conducted. These 40 
      core variables across the three EHDs and all variables in each EHD along with 
      those in the US MS CDM and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM 
      were compared for availability and labeled based on specific standards. RESULTS: 
      All of the EHDs' custodians confirmed their willingness to share their databases 
      with academic institutions after appropriate approval was obtained. The regional 
      community-based database contained 1.19 million people in 2015 with 85% of core 
      variables. Resampled annually nationwide, the national claims database included 
      5.4 million people in 2014 with 55% of core variables, and the EMR database 
      included 3 million inpatients from 60 hospitals in 2015 with 80% of core 
      variables. Compared with MS CDM or OMOP CDM, the proportion of variables across 
      the three EHDs available or able to be transformed/derived from the original 
      sources are 24-83% or 45-73%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These EHDs provide 
      potential value to post-marketing drug safety surveillance and 
      pharmacoepidemiology in China. Future research is warranted to assess the quality 
      and completeness of these EHDs or additional data sources in China.

TI  - Coronary Artery Computed Tomography Angiography for Preventing 
      Cardio-Cerebrovascular Disease: Observational Cohort Study Using the 
      Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Common Data Model.
PG  - e41503
LID - 10.2196/41503 [doi]
LID - e41503
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) result in 17.5 million deaths 
      annually worldwide, accounting for 46.2% of noncommunicable causes of death, and 
      are the leading cause of death, followed by cancer, respiratory disease, and 
      diabetes mellitus. Coronary artery computed tomography angiography (CCTA), which 
      detects calcification in the coronary arteries, can be used to detect 
      asymptomatic but serious vascular disease. It allows for noninvasive and quick 
      testing despite involving radiation exposure. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our 
      study was to investigate the effectiveness of CCTA screening on CVD outcomes by 
      using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) data and the 
      population-level estimation method. METHODS: Using electronic health record-based 
      OMOP-CDM data, including health questionnaire responses, adults (aged 30-74 
      years) without a history of CVD were selected, and 5-year CVD outcomes were 
      compared between patients undergoing CCTA (target group) and a comparison group 
      via 1:1 propensity score matching. Participants were stratified into low-risk and 
      high-risk groups based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
      Association atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score and 
      Framingham risk score (FRS) for subgroup analyses. RESULTS: The 2-year and 5-year 
      risk scores were compared as secondary outcomes between the two groups. In total, 
      8787 participants were included in both the target group and comparison group. No 
      significant differences (calibration P=.37) were found between the hazard ratios 
      of the groups at 5 years. The subgroup analysis also revealed no significant 
      differences between the ASCVD risk scores and FRSs of the groups at 5 years 
      (ASCVD risk score: P=.97; FRS: P=.85). However, the CCTA group showed a 
      significantly lower increase in risk scores at 2 years (ASCVD risk score: P=.03; 
      FRS: P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although we could not confirm a significant difference 
      in the preventive effects of CCTA screening for CVDs over a long period of 5 
      years, it may have a beneficial effect on risk score management over 2 years.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Quality indicators play an essential role in a learning health 
      system. They help healthcare providers to monitor the quality and safety of care 
      delivered and to identify areas for improvement. Clinical quality indicators, 
      therefore, need to be based on real world data. Generating reliable and 
      actionable data routinely is challenging. Healthcare data are often stored in 
      different formats and use different terminologies and coding systems, making it 
      difficult to generate and compare indicator reports from different sources. 
      METHODS: The Observational Health Sciences and Informatics community maintains 
      the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP). This is 
      an open data standard providing a computable and interoperable format for real 
      world data. We implemented a Computable Biomedical Knowledge Object (CBK) in the 
      Piano Platform based on OMOP. The CBK calculates an inpatient quality indicator 
      and was illustrated using synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data in the 
      open OMOP standard. RESULTS: The CBK reported the in-hospital mortality of 
      patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the synthetic EHR 
      dataset and includes interactive visualizations and the results of calculations. 
      Value sets composed of OMOP concept codes for AMI and comorbidities used in the 
      indicator calculation were also created. CONCLUSION: Computable biomedical 
      knowledge (CBK) objects that operate on OMOP data can be reused across datasets 
      that conform to OMOP. With OMOP being a widely used interoperability standard, 
      quality indicators embedded in CBKs can accelerate the generation of evidence for 
      targeted quality and safety management, improving care to benefit larger 
      populations.

AB  - Social determinants of health (SDoH) are increasingly important factors for 
      population health, healthcare outcomes, and care delivery. However, many of these 
      factors are not reliably captured within structured electronic health record 
      (EHR) data. In this work, we evaluated and adapted a previously published NLP 
      tool to include additional social risk factors for deployment at Vanderbilt 
      University Medical Center in an Acute Myocardial Infarction cohort. We developed 
      a transformation of the SDoH outputs of the tool into the OMOP common data model 
      (CDM) for re-use across many potential use cases, yielding performance measures 
      across 8 SDoH classes of precision 0.83 recall 0.74 and F-measure of 0.78.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Efficient methods to obtain and benchmark national data are needed 
      to improve comparative quality assessment for children with type 1 diabetes 
      (T1D). PCORnet is a network of clinical data research networks whose 
      infrastructure includes standardization to a Common Data Model (CDM) 
      incorporating electronic health record (EHR)-derived data across multiple 
      clinical institutions. The study aimed to determine the feasibility of the 
      automated use of EHR data to assess comparative quality for T1D. METHODS: In two 
      PCORnet networks, PEDSnet and OneFlorida, the study assessed measures of glycemic 
      control, diabetic ketoacidosis admissions, and clinic visits in 2016-2018 among 
      youth 0-20 years of age. The study team developed measure EHR-based 
      specifications, identified institution-specific rates using data stored in the 
      CDM, and assessed agreement with manual chart review. RESULTS: Among 9,740 youth 
      with T1D across 12 institutions, one quarter (26%) had two or more measures of 
      A1c greater than 9% annually (min 5%, max 47%). The median A1c was 8.5% (min site 
      7.9, max site 10.2). Overall, 4% were hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis (min 
      2%, max 8%). The predictive value of the PCORnet CDM was >75% for all measures 
      and >90% for three measures. CONCLUSIONS: Using EHR-derived data to assess 
      comparative quality for T1D is a valid, efficient, and reliable data collection 
      tool for measuring T1D care and outcomes. Wide variations across institutions 
      were observed, and even the best-performing institutions often failed to achieve 
      the American Diabetes Association HbA1C goals (<7.5%).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementation of phenotype algorithms requires phenotype engineers 
      to interpret human-readable algorithms and translate the description (text and 
      flowcharts) into computable phenotypes - a process that can be labor intensive 
      and error prone. To address the critical need for reducing the implementation 
      efforts, it is important to develop portable algorithms. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective analysis of phenotype algorithms developed in the Electronic 
      Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network and identified common customization 
      tasks required for implementation. A novel scoring system was developed to 
      quantify portability from three aspects: Knowledge conversion, clause 
      Interpretation, and Programming (KIP). Tasks were grouped into twenty 
      representative categories. Experienced phenotype engineers were asked to estimate 
      the average time spent on each category and evaluate time saving enabled by a 
      common data model (CDM), specifically the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) model, for each category. RESULTS: A total of 485 distinct 
      clauses (phenotype criteria) were identified from 55 phenotype algorithms, 
      corresponding to 1153 customization tasks. In addition to 25 
      non-phenotype-specific tasks, 46 tasks are related to interpretation, 613 tasks 
      are related to knowledge conversion, and 469 tasks are related to programming. A 
      score between 0 and 2 (0 for easy, 1 for moderate, and 2 for difficult 
      portability) is assigned for each aspect, yielding a total KIP score range of 0 
      to 6. The average clause-wise KIP score to reflect portability is 1.37 ± 1.38. 
      Specifically, the average knowledge (K) score is 0.64 ± 0.66, interpretation (I) 
      score is 0.33 ± 0.55, and programming (P) score is 0.40 ± 0.64. 5% of the 
      categories can be completed within one hour (median). 70% of the categories take 
      from days to months to complete. The OMOP model can assist with vocabulary 
      mapping tasks. CONCLUSION: This study presents firsthand knowledge of the 
      substantial implementation efforts in phenotyping and introduces a novel metric 
      (KIP) to measure portability of phenotype algorithms for quantifying such efforts 
      across the eMERGE Network. Phenotype developers are encouraged to analyze and 
      optimize the portability in regards to knowledge, interpretation and programming. 
      CDMs can be used to improve the portability for some 'knowledge-oriented' tasks.

TI  - Transforming Primary Care Data Into the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership Common Data Model: Development and Usability Study.
PG  - e49542
LID - 10.2196/49542 [doi]
LID - e49542
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-monitoring software generates a large amount of data that can 
      be reused for clinical audits and scientific research. The Observational Health 
      Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium developed the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize 
      electronic health record data and promote large-scale observational and 
      longitudinal research. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to transform primary care data 
      into the OMOP CDM format. METHODS: We extracted primary care data from electronic 
      health records at a multidisciplinary health center in Wattrelos, France. We 
      performed structural mapping between the design of our local primary care 
      database and the OMOP CDM tables and fields. Local French vocabularies concepts 
      were mapped to OHDSI standard vocabularies. To validate the implementation of 
      primary care data into the OMOP CDM format, we applied a set of queries. A 
      practical application was achieved through the development of a dashboard. 
      RESULTS: Data from 18,395 patients were implemented into the OMOP CDM, 
      corresponding to 592,226 consultations over a period of 20 years. A total of 18 
      OMOP CDM tables were implemented. A total of 17 local vocabularies were 
      identified as being related to primary care and corresponded to patient 
      characteristics (sex, location, year of birth, and race), units of measurement, 
      biometric measures, laboratory test results, medical histories, and drug 
      prescriptions. During semantic mapping, 10,221 primary care concepts were mapped 
      to standard OHDSI concepts. Five queries were used to validate the OMOP CDM by 
      comparing the results obtained after the completion of the transformations with 
      the results obtained in the source software. Lastly, a prototype dashboard was 
      developed to visualize the activity of the health center, the laboratory test 
      results, and the drug prescription data. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care data from a 
      French health care facility have been implemented into the OMOP CDM format. Data 
      concerning demographics, units, measurements, and primary care consultation steps 
      were already available in OHDSI vocabularies. Laboratory test results and drug 
      prescription data were mapped to available vocabularies and structured in the 
      final model. A dashboard application provided health care professionals with 
      feedback on their practice.

TI  - Computational Phenotyping of OMOP CDM Normalized EHR for Prenatal and Postpartum 
      Episodes: An Informatics Framework and Clinical Implementation on All of Us.
PG  - 1096-1104
AB  - The use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in pregnancy care and 
      obstetrics-gynecology (OB/GYN) research has increased in recent years. In 
      pregnancy, timing is important because clinical characteristics, risks, and 
      patient management are different in each stage of pregnancy. However, the 
      difficulty of accurately differentiating pregnancy episodes and temporal 
      information of clinical events presents unique challenges for EHR phenotyping. In 
      this work, we introduced the concept of time relativity and proposed a 
      comprehensive framework of computational phenotyping for prenatal and postpartum 
      episodes based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common 
      Data Model (CDM). We implemented it on the All of Us national EHR database and 
      identified 6,280 pregnancies with accurate start and end dates among 5,399 female 
      patients. With the ability to identify different episodes in pregnancy care, this 
      framework provides new opportunities for phenotyping complex clinical events and 
      gestational morbidities for pregnant women, thus improving maternal and infant 
      health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To advance new therapies into clinical care, clinical trials must 
      recruit enough participants. Yet, many trials fail to do so, leading to delays, 
      early trial termination, and wasted resources. Under-enrolling trials make it 
      impossible to draw conclusions about the efficacy of new therapies. An oft-cited 
      reason for insufficient enrollment is lack of study team and provider awareness 
      about patient eligibility. Automating clinical trial eligibility surveillance and 
      study team and provider notification could offer a solution. METHODS: To address 
      this need for an automated solution, we conducted an observational pilot study of 
      our TAES (TriAl Eligibility Surveillance) system. We tested the hypothesis that 
      an automated system based on natural language processing and machine learning 
      algorithms could detect patients eligible for specific clinical trials by linking 
      the information extracted from trial descriptions to the corresponding clinical 
      information in the electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate the TAES 
      information extraction and matching prototype (i.e., TAES prototype), we selected 
      five open cardiovascular and cancer trials at the Medical University of South 
      Carolina and created a new reference standard of 21,974 clinical text notes from 
      a random selection of 400 patients (including at least 100 enrolled in the 
      selected trials), with a small subset of 20 notes annotated in detail. We also 
      developed a simple web interface for a new database that stores all trial 
      eligibility criteria, corresponding clinical information, and trial-patient match 
      characteristics using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) 
      common data model. Finally, we investigated options for integrating an automated 
      clinical trial eligibility system into the EHR and for notifying health care 
      providers promptly of potential patient eligibility without interrupting their 
      clinical workflow. RESULTS: Although the rapidly implemented TAES prototype 
      achieved only moderate accuracy (recall up to 0.778; precision up to 1.000), it 
      enabled us to assess options for integrating an automated system successfully 
      into the clinical workflow at a healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: Once optimized, 
      the TAES system could exponentially enhance identification of patients 
      potentially eligible for clinical trials, while simultaneously decreasing the 
      burden on research teams of manual EHR review. Through timely notifications, it 
      could also raise physician awareness of patient eligibility for clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In a multisite clinical research collaboration, institutions may or 
      may not use the same common data model (CDM) to store clinical data. To overcome 
      this challenge, we proposed to use Health Level 7's Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as a meta-CDM-a single standard to represent 
      clinical data. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to create an open-source 
      application termed the Clinical Asset Mapping Program for FHIR (CAMP FHIR) to 
      efficiently transform clinical data to FHIR for supporting source-agnostic 
      CDM-to-FHIR mapping. METHODS: Mapping with CAMP FHIR involves (1) mapping each 
      source variable to its corresponding FHIR element and (2) mapping each item in 
      the source data's value sets to the corresponding FHIR value set item for 
      variables with strict value sets. To date, CAMP FHIR has been used to transform 
      108 variables from the Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) 
      and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network data models to fields across 7 
      FHIR resources. It is designed to allow input from any source data model and will 
      support additional FHIR resources in the future. RESULTS: We have used CAMP FHIR 
      to transform data on approximately 23,000 patients with asthma from our 
      institution's i2b2 database. Data quality and integrity were validated against 
      the origin point of the data, our enterprise clinical data warehouse. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We believe that CAMP FHIR can serve as an alternative to 
      implementing new CDMs on a project-by-project basis. Moreover, the use of FHIR as 
      a CDM could support rare data sharing opportunities, such as collaborations 
      between academic medical centers and community hospitals. We anticipate adoption 
      and use of CAMP FHIR to foster sharing of clinical data across institutions for 
      downstream applications in translational research.

TI  - An Ontology-Based Approach for Consolidating Patient Data Standardized With 
      European Norm/International Organization for Standardization 13606 (EN/ISO 13606) 
      Into Joint Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Repositories: 
      Description of a Methodology.
PG  - e44547
LID - 10.2196/44547 [doi]
LID - e44547
AB  - BACKGROUND: To discover new knowledge from data, they must be correct and in a 
      consistent format. OntoCR, a clinical repository developed at Hospital Clínic de 
      Barcelona, uses ontologies to represent clinical knowledge and map locally 
      defined variables to health information standards and common data models. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to design and implement a scalable methodology 
      based on the dual-model paradigm and the use of ontologies to consolidate 
      clinical data from different organizations in a standardized repository for 
      research purposes without loss of meaning. METHODS: First, the relevant clinical 
      variables are defined, and the corresponding European Norm/International 
      Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 archetypes are created. Data 
      sources are then identified, and an extract, transform, and load process is 
      carried out. Once the final data set is obtained, the data are transformed to 
      create EN/ISO 13606-normalized electronic health record (EHR) extracts. 
      Afterward, ontologies that represent archetyped concepts and map them to EN/ISO 
      13606 and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) 
      standards are created and uploaded to OntoCR. Data stored in the extracts are 
      inserted into its corresponding place in the ontology, thus obtaining 
      instantiated patient data in the ontology-based repository. Finally, data can be 
      extracted via SPARQL queries as OMOP CDM-compliant tables. RESULTS: Using this 
      methodology, EN/ISO 13606-standardized archetypes that allow for the reuse of 
      clinical information were created, and the knowledge representation of our 
      clinical repository by modeling and mapping ontologies was extended. Furthermore, 
      EN/ISO 13606-compliant EHR extracts of patients (6803), episodes (13,938), 
      diagnosis (190,878), administered medication (222,225), cumulative drug dose 
      (222,225), prescribed medication (351,247), movements between units (47,817), 
      clinical observations (6,736,745), laboratory observations (3,392,873), 
      limitation of life-sustaining treatment (1,298), and procedures (19,861) were 
      created. Since the creation of the application that inserts data from extracts 
      into the ontologies is not yet finished, the queries were tested and the 
      methodology was validated by importing data from a random subset of patients into 
      the ontologies using a locally developed Protégé plugin ("OntoLoad"). In total, 
      10 OMOP CDM-compliant tables ("Condition_occurrence," 864 records; "Death," 110; 
      "Device_exposure," 56; "Drug_exposure," 5609; "Measurement," 2091; "Observation," 
      195; "Observation_period," 897; "Person," 922; "Visit_detail," 772; and 
      "Visit_occurrence," 971) were successfully created and populated. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study proposes a methodology for standardizing clinical data, thus allowing 
      its reuse without any changes in the meaning of the modeled concepts. Although 
      this paper focuses on health research, our methodology suggests that the data be 
      initially standardized per EN/ISO 13606 to obtain EHR extracts with a high level 
      of granularity that can be used for any purpose. Ontologies constitute a valuable 
      approach for knowledge representation and standardization of health information 
      in a standard-agnostic manner. With the proposed methodology, institutions can go 
      from local raw data to standardized, semantically interoperable EN/ISO 13606 and 
      OMOP repositories.

TI  - A Path to Real-World Evidence in Critical Care Using Open-Source Data 
      Harmonization Tools.

AB  - COVID-19 highlighted the need for use of real-world data (RWD) in critical care 
      as a near real-time resource for clinical, research, and policy efforts. Analysis 
      of RWD is gaining momentum and can generate important evidence for policy makers 
      and regulators. Extracting high quality RWD from electronic health records (EHRs) 
      requires sophisticated infrastructure and dedicated resources. We sought to 
      customize freely available public tools, supporting all phases of data 
      harmonization, from data quality assessments to de-identification procedures, and 
      generation of robust, data science ready RWD from EHRs. These data are made 
      available to clinicians and researchers through CURE ID, a free platform which 
      facilitates access to case reports of challenging clinical cases and repurposed 
      treatments hosted by the National Center for Advancing Translational 
      Sciences/National Institutes of Health in partnership with the Food and Drug 
      Administration. This commentary describes the partnership, rationale, process, 
      use case, impact in critical care, and future directions for this collaborative 
      effort.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI231108 [doi]
AB  - The Health-Analytics Data to Evidence Suite (HADES) is an open-source software 
      collection developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics 
      (OHDSI). It executes directly against healthcare data such as electronic health 
      records and administrative claims, that have been converted to the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. Using advanced analytics, 
      HADES performs characterization, population-level causal effect estimation, and 
      patient-level prediction, potentially across a federated data network, allowing 
      patient-level data to remain locally while only aggregated statistics are shared. 
      Designed to run across a wide array of technical environments, including 
      different operating systems and database platforms, HADES uses continuous 
      integration with a large set of unit tests to maintain reliability. HADES 
      implements OHDSI best practices, and is used in almost all published OHDSI 
      studies, including some that have directly informed regulatory decisions.

TI  - DESIGN DIFFERENCES EXPLAIN VARIATION IN RESULTS BETWEEN RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND 
      THEIR NON-RANDOMIZED EMULATIONS.

LID - 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292601 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered a standard 
      for evidence on the efficacy of medical treatments, non-randomized real-world 
      evidence (RWE) studies using data from health insurance claims or electronic 
      health records can provide important complementary evidence. The use of RWE to 
      inform decision-making has been questioned because of concerns regarding 
      confounding in non-randomized studies and the use of secondary data. 
      RCT-DUPLICATE was a demonstration project that emulated the design of 32 RCTs 
      with non-randomized RWE studies. We sought to explore how emulation differences 
      relate to variation in results between the RCT-RWE study pairs. METHODS: We 
      include all RCT-RWE study pairs from RCT-DUPLICATE where the measure of effect 
      was a hazard ratio and use exploratory meta-regression methods to explain 
      differences and variation in the effect sizes between the results from the RCT 
      and the RWE study. The considered explanatory variables are related to design and 
      population differences. RESULTS: Most of the observed variation in effect 
      estimates between RCT-RWE study pairs in this sample could be explained by three 
      emulation differences in the meta-regression model: (i) in-hospital start of 
      treatment (not observed in claims data), (ii) discontinuation of certain baseline 
      therapies at randomization (not part of clinical practice), (iii) delayed onset 
      of drug effects (missed by short medication persistence in clinical practice). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that a substantial proportion of the observed 
      variation between results from RCTs and RWE studies can be attributed to design 
      emulation differences. (238 words).

AB  - The 21(st) Century Cures Act allows the US Food and Drug Administration to 
      consider real world data (RWD) for new indications or post approval study 
      requirements. However, there is limited guidance as to the relative quality of 
      different RWD types. The ACE-RWD program will compare the quality of EHR clinical 
      data, EHR billing data, and linked healthcare claims data to traditional clinical 
      trial data collection methods. ACE-RWD is being conducted alongside 5-10 
      ancillary studies, with five sponsors, across multiple therapeutic areas. Each 
      ancillary study will be conducted after or in parallel with its parent clinical 
      study at a minimum of two clinical sites. Although not required, it is 
      anticipated that EHR clinical and EHR billing data will be obtained via 
      EHR-to-eCRF mechanisms that are based on the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast 
      Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard.

TI  - Comparison of the cohort selection performance of Australian Medicines 
      Terminology to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical mappings.
PG  - 1237-1246
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz143 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records are increasingly utilized for observational 
      and clinical research. Identification of cohorts using electronic health records 
      is an important step in this process. Previous studies largely focused on the 
      methods of cohort selection, but there is little evidence on the impact of 
      underlying vocabularies and mappings between vocabularies used for cohort 
      selection. We aim to compare the cohort selection performance using Australian 
      Medicines Terminology to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) mappings from 2 
      different sources. These mappings were taken from the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) and the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
      Scheme (PBS) schedule. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved patients from the 
      electronic Practice Based Research Network data repository using 3 ATC 
      classification groups (A10, N02A, N06A). The retrieved patients were further 
      verified manually and pooled to form a reference standard which was used to 
      assess the accuracy of mappings using precision, recall, and F measure metrics. 
      RESULTS: The OMOP-CDM mappings identified 2.6%, 15.2%, and 24.4% more drugs than 
      the PBS mappings in the A10, N02A and N06A groups respectively. Despite this, the 
      PBS mappings generally performed the same in cohort selection as OMOP-CDM 
      mappings except for the N02A Opioids group, where a significantly greater number 
      of patients were retrieved. Both mappings exhibited variable recall, but perfect 
      precision, with all drugs found to be correctly identified. CONCLUSION: We found 
      that 1 of the 3 ATC groups had a significant difference and this affected cohort 
      selection performance. Our findings highlighted that underlying terminology 
      mappings can greatly impact cohort selection accuracy. Clinical researchers 
      should carefully evaluate vocabulary mapping sources including methodologies used 
      to develop those mappings.

AB  - Background PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors 
      effectively lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and have been shown 
      to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients. We used real-world 
      electronic health record data to characterize use of PCSK9 inhibitors, in 
      addition to standard therapies, according to cardiovascular risk status. Methods 
      and Results Data were obtained from 18 health systems with data marts within the 
      National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) using a common data 
      model. Participating sites identified >17.5 million adults, of whom 3.6 million 
      met study criteria. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: (1) dyslipidemia, 
      (2) untreated LDL ≥130 mg/dL, and (3) coronary artery disease or coronary heart 
      disease. Demographics, comorbidities, estimated 10-year atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease risk, and lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies were summarized 
      for each group. Participants' average age was 62 years, 50% were female, and 11% 
      were black. LDL cholesterol ranged from 85 to 151 mg/dL. Among patients in groups 
      1 and 3, 54% received standard lipid-lowering therapies and a PCSK9 inhibitor was 
      prescribed in <1%. PCSK9 inhibitor prescribing was greatest for patients with 
      coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease and, although prescribing 
      increased during the study period, overall PCSK9 inhibitor prescribing was low. 
      Conclusions We successfully used electronic health record data from 18 PCORnet 
      data marts to identify >3.6 million patients meeting criteria for 3 patient 
      groups. Approximately half of patients had been prescribed lipid-lowering 
      medication, but <1% were prescribed PCSK9 inhibitors. PCSK9 inhibitor prescribing 
      increased over time for patients with coronary artery disease or coronary heart 
      disease but not for those with dyslipidemia.

TI  - Characterizing the Anticancer Treatment Trajectory and Pattern in Patients 
      Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer Using Harmonized Observational Databases: 
      Retrospective Study.
PG  - e25035
LID - 10.2196/25035 [doi]
LID - e25035
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and rapid clinical decisions based on real-world evidence 
      are essential for patients with cancer. However, the complexity of chemotherapy 
      regimens for cancer impedes retrospective research that uses observational health 
      databases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the anticancer 
      treatment trajectories and patterns of clinical events according to regimen type 
      using the chemotherapy episodes determined by an algorithm. METHODS: We developed 
      an algorithm to extract the regimen-level abstracted chemotherapy episodes from 
      medication records in a conventional Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 
      (OMOP) common data model (CDM) database. The algorithm was validated on the Ajou 
      University School Of Medicine (AUSOM) database by manual review of clinical 
      notes. Using the algorithm, we extracted episodes of chemotherapy from patients 
      in the EHR database and the claims database. We also developed an application 
      software for visualizing the chemotherapy treatment patterns based on the 
      treatment episodes in the OMOP-CDM database. Using this software, we generated 
      the trends in the types of regimen used in the institutions, the patterns of the 
      iterative chemotherapy use, and the trajectories of cancer treatment in two 
      EHR-based OMOP-CDM databases. As a pilot study, the time of onset of 
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia according to regimen was measured using the 
      AUSOM database. The anticancer treatment trajectories for patients with COVID-19 
      were also visualized based on the nationwide claims database. RESULTS: We 
      generated 178,360 treatment episodes for patients with colorectal, breast, and 
      lung cancer for 85 different regimens. The algorithm precisely identified the 
      type of chemotherapy regimen in 400 patients (average positive predictive value 
      >98%). The trends in the use of routine clinical chemotherapy regimens from 
      2008-2018 were identified for 8236 patients. For a total of 12 regimens (those 
      administered to the largest proportion of patients), the number of repeated 
      treatments was concordant with the protocols for standard chemotherapy regimens 
      for certain cases. In addition, the anticancer treatment trajectories for 8315 
      patients were shown, including 62 patients with COVID-19. A comparative analysis 
      of neutropenia showed that its onset in colorectal cancer regimens tended to 
      cluster between days 9-15, whereas it tended to cluster between days 2-8 for 
      certain regimens for breast cancer or lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a 
      method for generating chemotherapy episodes for introduction into the oncology 
      extension module of the OMOP-CDM databases. These proof-of-concept studies 
      demonstrated the usability, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed 
      framework through a distributed research network.

TI  - OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies-a large-scale centralized reference ontology for 
      international data harmonization.
PG  - 583-590
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocad247 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) is the 
      largest distributed data network in the world encompassing more than 331 data 
      sources with 2.1 billion patient records across 34 countries. It enables 
      large-scale observational research through standardizing the data into a common 
      data model (CDM) (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [OMOP] CDM) and 
      requires a comprehensive, efficient, and reliable ontology system to support data 
      harmonization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created the OHDSI Standardized 
      Vocabularies-a common reference ontology mandatory to all data sites in the 
      network. It comprises imported and de novo-generated ontologies containing 
      concepts and relationships between them, and the praxis of converting the source 
      data to the OMOP CDM based on these. It enables harmonization through assigned 
      domains according to clinical categories, comprehensive coverage of entities 
      within each domain, support for commonly used international coding schemes, and 
      standardization of semantically equivalent concepts. RESULTS: The OHDSI 
      Standardized Vocabularies comprise over 10 million concepts from 136 
      vocabularies. They are used by hundreds of groups and several large data 
      networks. More than 8600 users have performed 50 000 downloads of the system. 
      This open-source resource has proven to address an impediment of large-scale 
      observational research-the dependence on the context of source data 
      representation. With that, it has enabled efficient phenotyping, covariate 
      construction, patient-level prediction, population-level estimation, and standard 
      reporting. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: OHDSI has made available a comprehensive, 
      open vocabulary system that is unmatched in its ability to support global 
      observational research. We encourage researchers to exploit it and contribute 
      their use cases to this dynamic resource.

TI  - Design and analysis choices for safety surveillance evaluations need to be tuned 
      to the specifics of the hypothesized drug-outcome association.
PG  - 973-81

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reviewed the results of the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Research Partnership (OMOP) 2010 Experiment in hopes of finding examples where 
      apparently well-designed drug studies repeatedly produce anomalous findings. OMOP 
      had applied thousands of designs and design parameters to 53 drug-outcome pairs 
      across 10 electronic data resources. Our intent was to use this repository to 
      elucidate some sources of error in observational studies. METHOD: From the 2010 
      OMOP Experiment, we sought drug-outcome-method combinations (DOMCs) that met 
      consensus design criteria, yet repeatedly produced results contrary to 
      expectation. We set aside DOMCs for which we could not agree on the suitability 
      of the designs, then selected for an in-depth scrutiny one drug-outcome pair 
      analyzed by a seemingly plausible methodological approach, whose results 
      consistently disagreed with the a priori expectation. RESULTS: The OMOP 
      "all-by-all" assessment of possible DOMCs yielded many combinations that would 
      not be chosen by researchers as actual study options. Among those that passed a 
      first level of scrutiny, two of seven drug-outcome pairs for which there were 
      plausible research designs had anomalous results. The use of benzodiazepines was 
      unexpectedly associated with acute renal failure and upper gastrointestinal 
      bleeding. We chose the latter as an example for in-depth study. The factitious 
      appearance of a bleeding risk may have been partly driven by an excess of 
      procedures on the first day of treatment. A risk window definition that excluded 
      the first day largely removed the spurious association. CONCLUSION: One cause of 
      reproducible "error" may be repeated failure to tie design choices closely enough 
      to the research question at hand. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Conversion and Data Quality Assessment of Electronic Health Record Data at a 
      Korean Tertiary Teaching Hospital to a Common Data Model for Distributed Network 
      Research.
PG  - 54-8
LID - 10.4258/hir.2016.22.1.54 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A distributed research network (DRN) has the advantages of improved 
      statistical power, and it can reveal more significant relationships by increasing 
      sample size. However, differences in data structure constitute a major barrier to 
      integrating data among DRN partners. We describe our experience converting 
      Electronic Health Records (EHR) to the Observational Health Data Sciences and 
      Informatics (OHDSI) Common Data Model (CDM). METHODS: We transformed the EHR of a 
      hospital into Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM ver. 4.0 used 
      in OHDSI. All EHR codes were mapped and converted into the standard vocabulary of 
      the CDM. All data required by the CDM were extracted, transformed, and loaded 
      (ETL) into the CDM structure. To validate and improve the quality of the 
      transformed dataset, the open-source data characterization program ACHILLES was 
      run on the converted data. RESULTS: Patient, drug, condition, procedure, and 
      visit data from 2.07 million patients who visited the subject hospital from July 
      1994 to November 2014 were transformed into the CDM. The transformed dataset was 
      named the AUSOM. ACHILLES revealed 36 errors and 13 warnings in the AUSOM. We 
      reviewed and corrected 28 errors. The summarized results of the AUSOM processed 
      with ACHILLES are available at http://ami.ajou.ac.kr:8080/. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      successfully converted our EHRs to a CDM and were able to participate as a data 
      partner in an international DRN. Converting local records in this manner will 
      provide various opportunities for researchers and data holders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite easy-to-use tools like the Cohort Builder, using All of Us 
      Research Program data for complex research questions requires a relatively high 
      level of technical expertise. We aimed to increase research and training capacity 
      and reduce barriers to entry for the All of Us community through an R package, 
      allofus. In this article, we describe functions that address common challenges we 
      encountered while working with All of Us Research Program data, and we 
      demonstrate this functionality with an example of creating a cohort of All of Us 
      participants by synthesizing electronic health record and survey data with time 
      dependencies. TARGET AUDIENCE: All of Us Research Program data are widely 
      available to health researchers. The allofus R package is aimed at a wide range 
      of researchers who wish to conduct complex analyses using best practices for 
      reproducibility and transparency, and who have a range of experience using R. 
      Because the All of Us data are transformed into the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), researchers familiar with 
      existing OMOP CDM tools or who wish to conduct network studies in conjunction 
      with other OMOP CDM data will also find value in the package. SCOPE: We developed 
      an initial set of functions that solve problems we experienced across survey and 
      electronic health record data in our own research and in mentoring student 
      projects. The package will continue to grow and develop with the All of Us 
      Research Program. The allofus R package can help build community research 
      capacity by increasing access to the All of Us Research Program data, the 
      efficiency of its use, and the rigor and reproducibility of the resulting 
      research.

TI  - Development and validation of a prognostic model predicting symptomatic 
      hemorrhagic transformation in acute ischemic stroke at scale in the OHDSI 
      network.
PG  - e0226718
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0226718 [doi]
LID - e0226718
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after cerebral infarction 
      is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon in the acute stage of ischemic stroke, 
      and often results in a poor prognosis. Thus, identifying risk factors and making 
      an early prediction of HT in acute cerebral infarction contributes not only to 
      the selections of therapeutic regimen but also, more importantly, to the 
      improvement of prognosis of acute cerebral infarction. The purpose of this study 
      was to develop and validate a model to predict a patient's risk of HT within 30 
      days of initial ischemic stroke. METHODS: We utilized a retrospective multicenter 
      observational cohort study design to develop a Lasso Logistic Regression 
      prediction model with a large, US Electronic Health Record dataset which 
      structured to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data 
      Model (CDM). To examine clinical transportability, the model was externally 
      validated across 10 additional real-world healthcare datasets include EHR records 
      for patients from America, Europe and Asia. RESULTS: In the database the model 
      was developed, the target population cohort contained 621,178 patients with 
      ischemic stroke, of which 5,624 patients had HT within 30 days following initial 
      ischemic stroke. 612 risk predictors, including the distance a patient travels in 
      an ambulance to get to care for a HT, were identified. An area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 was achieved in the internal 
      validation of the risk model. External validation was performed across 10 
      databases totaling 5,515,508 patients with ischemic stroke, of which 86,401 
      patients had HT within 30 days following initial ischemic stroke. The mean 
      external AUC was 0.71 and ranged between 0.60-0.78. CONCLUSIONS: A HT prognostic 
      predict model was developed with Lasso Logistic Regression based on routinely 
      collected EMR data. This model can identify patients who have a higher risk of HT 
      than the population average with an AUC of 0.78. It shows the OMOP CDM is an 
      appropriate data standard for EMR secondary use in clinical multicenter research 
      for prognostic prediction model development and validation. In the future, 
      combining this model with clinical information systems will assist clinicians to 
      make the right therapy decision for patients with acute ischemic stroke.

TI  - Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Prevalence in Bulgaria During 2018: Nationally 
      Representative Study.
PG  - 262-266
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240394 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents data analysis of a large dataset of outpatient records for 
      the purpose of establishing accurate prevalence rates of dementia and Alzheimer's 
      disease in Bulgaria. The research is motivated by the lack of accurate prevalence 
      data as well as statistics about the actual number of people affected by dementia 
      at national level. Health data from pseudonymized outpatient records (1,378,355) 
      of 642,013 unique patients (Male 39.88%, Female 61.67%) with visits to 
      neurologists and psychiatrists in 2018 was mapped to an OMOP CDM relational 
      database. The size of this dataset is one of largest in the EU context. 
      Prevalence of dementia for all age groups [30,100+] years is 1.61% (Male 0.62%, 
      Female 0.99%) and Alzheimer' disease prevalence is 0.39% (Male 0.15%, Female 
      0.24%), where 24.34% of all the patients with dementia suffer Alzheimer's 
      disease. The mean prevalence rates of dementia and Alzheimer's disease for ages 
      above 64 are 9.52% (CI 95%, [6.98%, 12.04%]) and 1.04 % (CI 95%, [0.84%, 
      1.27%,]). A comparison with EU statistics yields 0.07% difference for dementia 
      prevalence, while data visualization confirms the known patterns of prevalence 
      with aging and gender specifics These results stimulate further research and 
      support the development of a national strategy for dementia and Alzheimer's 
      disease.

TI  - Taipei Medical University Clinical Research Database: a collaborative hospital 
      EHR database aligned with international common data standards.
LID - 10.1136/bmjhci-2023-100890 [doi]
LID - e100890
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of 
      the development and features of the Taipei Medical University Clinical Research 
      Database (TMUCRD), a repository of real-world data (RWD) derived from electronic 
      health records (EHRs) and other sources. METHODS: TMUCRD was developed by 
      integrating EHRs from three affiliated hospitals, including Taipei Medical 
      University Hospital, Wan-Fang Hospital and Shuang-Ho Hospital. The data cover 
      over 15 years and include diverse patient care information. The database was 
      converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model 
      (OMOP CDM) for standardisation. RESULTS: TMUCRD comprises 89 tables (eg, 29 
      tables for each hospital and 2 linked tables), including demographics, diagnoses, 
      medications, procedures and measurements, among others. It encompasses data from 
      more than 4.15 million patients with various medical records, spanning from the 
      year 2004 to 2021. The dataset offers insights into disease prevalence, 
      medication usage, laboratory tests and patient characteristics. DISCUSSION: 
      TMUCRD stands out due to its unique advantages, including diverse data types, 
      comprehensive patient information, linked mortality and cancer registry data, 
      regular updates and a swift application process. Its compatibility with the OMOP 
      CDM enhances its usability and interoperability. CONCLUSION: TMUCRD serves as a

TI  - ASH Research Collaborative: a real-world data infrastructure to support 
      real-world evidence development and learning healthcare systems in hematology.
PG  - 5429-5438

AB  - The ASH Research Collaborative is a nonprofit organization established through 
      the American Society of Hematology's commitment to patients with hematologic 
      conditions and the science that informs clinical care and future therapies. The 
      ASH Research Collaborative houses 2 major initiatives: (1) the Data Hub and (2) 
      the Clinical Trials Network (CTN). The Data Hub is a program for hematologic 
      diseases in which networks of clinical care delivery sites are developed in 
      specific disease areas, with individual patient data contributed through 
      electronic health record (EHR) integration, direct data entry through electronic 
      data capture, and external data sources. Disease-specific data models are 
      constructed so that data can be assembled into analytic datasets and used to 
      enhance clinical care through dashboards and other mechanisms. Initial models 
      have been built in multiple myeloma (MM) and sickle cell disease (SCD) using the 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and 
      Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. The Data Hub also 
      provides a framework for development of disease-specific learning communities 
      (LC) and testing of health care delivery strategies. The ASH Research 
      Collaborative SCD CTN is a clinical trials accelerator that creates efficiencies 
      in the execution of multicenter clinical trials and has been initially developed 
      for SCD. Both components are operational, with the Data Hub actively aggregating 
      source data and the SCD CTN reviewing study candidates. This manuscript describes 
      processes involved in developing core features of the ASH Research Collaborative 
      to inform the stakeholder community in preparation for expansion to additional 
      disease areas.

TI  - Use of Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Standards for 
      Real-world Data: Expert Perspectives From a Qualitative Delphi Survey.
PG  - e30363
LID - 10.2196/30363 [doi]
LID - e30363
AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) are playing 
      increasingly important roles in clinical research and health care 
      decision-making. To leverage RWD and generate reliable RWE, data should be well 
      defined and structured in a way that is semantically interoperable and consistent 
      across stakeholders. The adoption of data standards is one of the cornerstones 
      supporting high-quality evidence for the development of clinical medicine and 
      therapeutics. Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) data 
      standards are mature, globally recognized, and heavily used by the pharmaceutical 
      industry for regulatory submissions. The CDISC RWD Connect Initiative aims to 
      better understand the barriers to implementing CDISC standards for RWD and to 
      identify the tools and guidance needed to more easily implement them. OBJECTIVE: 
      The aim of this study is to understand the barriers to implementing CDISC 
      standards for RWD and to identify the tools and guidance that may be needed to 
      implement CDISC standards more easily for this purpose. METHODS: We conducted a 
      qualitative Delphi survey involving an expert advisory board with multiple key 
      stakeholders, with 3 rounds of input and review. RESULTS: Overall, 66 experts 
      participated in round 1, 56 in round 2, and 49 in round 3 of the Delphi survey. 
      Their inputs were collected and analyzed, culminating in group statements. It was 
      widely agreed that the standardization of RWD is highly necessary, and the 
      primary focus should be on its ability to improve data sharing and the quality of 
      RWE. The priorities for RWD standardization included electronic health records, 
      such as data shared using Health Level 7 Fast Health care Interoperability 
      Resources (FHIR), and the data stemming from observational studies. With 
      different standardization efforts already underway in these areas, a gap analysis 
      should be performed to identify the areas where synergies and efficiencies are 
      possible and then collaborate with stakeholders to create or extend existing 
      mappings between CDISC and other standards, controlled terminologies, and models 
      to represent data originating across different sources. CONCLUSIONS: There are 
      many ongoing data standardization efforts around human health data-related 
      activities, each with different definitions, levels of granularity, and purpose. 
      Among these, CDISC has been successful in standardizing clinical trial-based data 
      for regulation worldwide. However, the complexity of the CDISC standards and the 
      fact that they were developed for different purposes, combined with the lack of 
      awareness and incentives to use a new standard and insufficient training and 
      implementation support, are significant barriers to setting up the use of CDISC 
      standards for RWD. The collection and dissemination of use cases, development of 
      tools and support systems for the RWD community, and collaboration with other 
      standards development organizations are potential steps forward. Using CDISC will 
      help link clinical trial data and RWD and promote innovation in health data 
      science.

TI  - Predictability of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment retention: A multi-site 
      analysis combining electronic health records and machine learning.
PG  - 1792-1802
LID - 10.1111/add.16587 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid dependence lead to 
      significant morbidity and mortality, yet treatment retention, crucial for the 
      effectiveness of medications like buprenorphine-naloxone, remains unpredictable. 
      Our objective was to determine the predictability of 6-month retention in 
      buprenorphine-naloxone treatment using electronic health record (EHR) data from 
      diverse clinical settings and to identify key predictors. DESIGN: This 
      retrospective observational study developed and validated machine learning-based 
      clinical risk prediction models using EHR data. SETTING AND CASES: Data were 
      sourced from Stanford University's healthcare system and Holmusk's NeuroBlu 
      database, reflecting a wide range of healthcare settings. The study analyzed 1800 
      Stanford and 7957 NeuroBlu treatment encounters from 2008 to 2023 and from 2003 
      to 2023, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Predict continuous prescription of 
      buprenorphine-naloxone for at least 6 months, without a gap of more than 30 days. 
      The performance of machine learning prediction models was assessed by area under 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) analysis as well as precision, recall 
      and calibration. To further validate our approach's clinical applicability, we 
      conducted two secondary analyses: a time-to-event analysis on a single site to 
      estimate the duration of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment continuity evaluated by 
      the C-index and a comparative evaluation against predictions made by three human 
      clinical experts. FINDINGS: Attrition rates at 6 months were 58% (NeuroBlu) and 
      61% (Stanford). Prediction models trained and internally validated on NeuroBlu 
      data achieved ROC-AUCs up to 75.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.6-78.0). 
      Addiction medicine specialists' predictions show a ROC-AUC of 67.8 (95% 
      CI = 50.4-85.2). Time-to-event analysis on Stanford data indicated a median 
      treatment retention time of 65 days, with random survival forest model achieving 
      an average C-index of 65.9. The top predictor of treatment retention identified 
      included the diagnosis of opioid dependence. CONCLUSIONS: US patients with opioid 
      use disorder or opioid dependence treated with buprenorphine-naloxone 
      prescriptions appear to have a high (∼60%) treatment attrition by 6 months. 
      Machine learning models trained on diverse electronic health record datasets 
      appear to be able to predict treatment continuity with accuracy comparable to 
      that of clinical experts.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study is part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s 
      Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) initiative, which aims to improve the 
      FDA's postmarket surveillance capabilities by using real-world data (RWD). In the 
      United States, using RWD for postmarket surveillance has been hindered by the 
      inability to exchange clinical data between healthcare providers and public 
      health organizations in an interoperable format. However, the Office of the 
      National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) has recently enacted 
      regulation requiring all healthcare providers to support seamless access, 
      exchange, and use of electronic health information through the interoperable HL7 
      Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. To leverage the 
      recent ONC changes, BEST designed a pilot platform to query and receive the 
      clinical information necessary to analyze suspected AEs. This study assessed the 
      feasibility of using the RWD received through the data exchange of FHIR resources 
      to study post-vaccination AE cases by evaluating the data volume, query response 
      time, and data quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used RWD from 283 
      post-vaccination AE cases, which were received through the platform. We used 
      descriptive statistics to report results and apply 322 data quality tests based 
      on a data quality framework for EHR. RESULTS: The volume analysis indicated the 
      average clinical resources for a post-vaccination AE case was 983.9 for the 
      median partner. The query response time analysis indicated that cases could be 
      received by the platform at a median of 3 min and 30 s. The quality analysis 
      indicated that most of the data elements and conformance requirements useful for 
      postmarket surveillance were met. DISCUSSION: This study describes the platform's 
      data volume, data query response time, and data quality results from the queried 
      postvaccination adverse event cases and identified updates to current standards 
      to close data quality gaps.

TI  - Application of a Data Quality Framework to Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Using 
      Electronic Health Record Data From the All of Us Research Program.
PG  - e2400052
LID - 10.1200/CCI.24.00052 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The specific aims of this paper are to (1) develop and operationalize an 
      electronic health record (EHR) data quality framework, (2) apply the dimensions 
      of the framework to the phenotype and treatment pathways of ductal carcinoma in 
      situ (DCIS) using All of Us Research Program data, and (3) propose and apply a 
      checklist to evaluate the application of the framework. METHODS: We developed a 
      framework of five data quality dimensions (DQD; completeness, concordance, 
      conformance, plausibility, and temporality). Participants signed a consent and 
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization to share EHR 
      data and responded to demographic questions in the Basics questionnaire. We 
      evaluated the internal characteristics of the data and compared data with 
      external benchmarks with descriptive and inferential statistics. We developed a 
      DQD checklist to evaluate concept selection, internal verification, and external 
      validity for each DQD. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data 
      Model (OMOP CDM) concept ID codes for DCIS were used to select a cohort of 2,209 
      females 18 years and older. RESULTS: Using the proposed DQD checklist criteria, 
      (1) concepts were selected and internally verified for conformance; (2) concepts 
      were selected and internally verified for completeness; (3) concepts were 
      selected, internally verified, and externally validated for concordance; (4) 
      concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for 
      plausibility; and (5) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally 
      validated for temporality. CONCLUSION: This assessment and evaluation provided 
      insights into data quality for the DCIS phenotype using EHR data from the All of 
      Us Research Program. The review demonstrates that salient clinical measures can 
      be selected, applied, and operationalized within a conceptual framework and 
      evaluated for fitness for use by applying a proposed checklist.

TI  - KG-LIME: predicting individualized risk of adverse drug events for multiple 
      sclerosis disease-modifying therapy.
PG  - 1693-1703
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocae155 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project was to create time-aware, individual-level 
      risk score models for adverse drug events related to multiple sclerosis 
      disease-modifying therapy and to provide interpretable explanations for model 
      prediction behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used temporal sequences of 
      observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) concepts 
      derived from an electronic health record as model features. Each concept was 
      assigned an embedding representation that was learned from a graph convolution 
      network trained on a knowledge graph (KG) of OMOP concept relationships. Concept 
      embeddings were fed into long short-term memory networks for 1-year adverse event 
      prediction following drug exposure. Finally, we implemented a novel extension of 
      the local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME) method, knowledge graph 
      LIME (KG-LIME) to leverage the KG and explain individual predictions of each 
      model. RESULTS: For a set of 4859 patients, we found that our model was effective 
      at predicting 32 out of 56 adverse event types (P < .05) when compared to 
      demographics and past diagnosis as variables. We also assessed discrimination in 
      the form of area under the curve (AUC = 0.77 ± 0.15) and area under the 
      precision-recall curve (AUC-PR = 0.31 ± 0.27) and assessed calibration in the 
      form of Brier score (BS = 0.04 ± 0.04). Additionally, KG-LIME generated 
      interpretable literature-validated lists of relevant medical concepts used for 
      prediction. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Many of our risk models demonstrated high 
      calibration and discrimination for adverse event prediction. Furthermore, our 
      novel KG-LIME method was able to utilize the knowledge graph to highlight 
      concepts that were important to prediction. Future work will be required to 
      further explore the temporal window of adverse event occurrence beyond the 
      generic 1-year window used here, particularly for short-term inpatient adverse 
      events and long-term severe adverse events.

TI  - From data strategy to implementation to advance cancer research and cancer care: 
      A French comprehensive cancer center experience.
PG  - e0000415

LID - e0000415
AB  - In a comprehensive cancer center, effective data strategies are essential to 
      evaluate practices, and outcome, understanding the disease and prognostic 
      factors, identifying disparities in cancer care, and overall developing better 
      treatments. To achieve these goals, the Center Léon Bérard (CLB) considers 
      various data collection strategies, including electronic medical records (EMRs), 
      clinical trial data, and research projects. Advanced data analysis techniques 
      like natural language processing (NLP) can be used to extract and categorize 
      information from these sources to provide a more complete description of patient 
      data. Data sharing is also crucial for collaboration across comprehensive cancer 
      centers, but it must be done securely and in compliance with regulations like 
      GDPR. To ensure data is shared appropriately, CLB should develop clear data 
      sharing policies and share data in a controlled, standardized format like OSIRIS 
      RWD, OMOP and FHIR. The UNICANCER initiative has launched the CONSORE project to 
      support the development of a structured and standardized repository of patient 
      data to improve cancer research and patient outcomes. Real-world data (RWD) 
      studies are vital in cancer research as they provide a comprehensive and accurate 
      picture of patient outcomes and treatment patterns. By incorporating RWD into 
      data collection, analysis, and sharing strategies, comprehensive cancer centers 
      can take a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach to cancer research. 
      In conclusion, comprehensive cancer centers must take an integrated approach to 
      data collection, analysis, and sharing to enhance their understanding of cancer 
      and improve patient outcomes. Leveraging advanced data analytics techniques and 
      developing effective data sharing policies can help cancer centers effectively 
      harness the power of data to drive progress in cancer research.

TI  - MetaLAB-HOI: Template standardization of health outcomes enable massive and 
      accurate detection of adverse drug reactions from electronic health records.
PG  - e5694
LID - 10.1002/pds.5694 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to advance the MetaLAB algorithm and verify its 
      performance with multicenter data to effectively detect major adverse drug 
      reactions (ADRs), including drug-induced liver injury. METHODS: Based on MetaLAB, 
      we created an optimal scenario for detecting ADRs by considering demographic and 
      clinical records. MetaLAB-HOI was developed to identify ADR signals using common 
      model-based multicenter electronic health record (EHR) data from the clinical 
      health outcomes of interest (HOI) template and design for drug-exposed and 
      nonexposed groups. In this study, we calculated the odds ratio of 101 drugs for 
      HOI in Konyang University Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, Chungbuk 
      National University Hospital, and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. 
      RESULTS: The overlapping drugs in four medical centers are amlodipine, aspirin, 
      bisoprolol, carvedilol, clopidogrel, clozapine, digoxin, diltiazem, methotrexate, 
      and rosuvastatin. We developed MetaLAB-HOI, an algorithm that can detect ADRs 
      more efficiently using EHR. We compared the detection results of four medical 
      centers, with drug-induced liver injuries as representative ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      MetaLAB-HOI's strength lies in fully utilizing the patient's clinical 
      information, such as prescription, procedure, and laboratory results, to detect 
      ADR signals. Considering changes in the patient's condition over time, we created 
      an algorithm based on a scenario that accounted for each drug exposure and onset 
      period supervised by specialists for HOI. We determined that when a template 
      capable of detecting ADR based on clinical evidence is developed and manualized, 
      it can be applied in medical centers for new drugs with insufficient data.

TI  - Content Coverage Evaluation of the OMOP Vocabulary on the Transplant Domain 
      Focusing on Concepts Relevant for Kidney Transplant Outcomes Analysis.
PG  - 650-658
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1716528 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving outcomes of transplant recipients within and across 
      transplant centers is important with the increasing number of organ 
      transplantations being performed. The current practice is to analyze the outcomes 
      based on patient level data submitted to the United Network for Organ Sharing 
      (UNOS). Augmenting the UNOS data with other sources such as the electronic health 
      record will enrich the outcomes analysis, for which a common data model (CDM) can 
      be a helpful tool for transforming heterogeneous source data into a uniform 
      format. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of representing 
      concepts from the UNOS transplant registry forms with the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM vocabulary to understand the content coverage of 
      OMOP vocabulary on transplant-specific concepts. METHODS: Two annotators manually 
      mapped a total of 3,571 unique concepts extracted from the UNOS registry forms to 
      concepts in the OMOP vocabulary. Concept mappings were evaluated by (1) examining 
      the agreement among the initial two annotators and (2) investigating the number 
      of UNOS concepts not mapped to a concept in the OMOP vocabulary and then 
      classifying them. A subset of mappings was validated by clinicians. RESULTS: 
      There was a substantial agreement between annotators with a kappa score of 0.71. 
      We found that 55.5% of UNOS concepts could not be represented with OMOP standard 
      concepts. The majority of unmapped UNOS concepts were categorized into 
      transplant, measurement, condition, and procedure concepts. CONCLUSION: We 
      identified categories of unmapped concepts and found that some 
      transplant-specific concepts do not exist in the OMOP vocabulary. We suggest that 
      adding these missing concepts to OMOP would facilitate further research in the 
      transplant domain.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of temporal pattern discovery: new application using 
      statins and rhabdomyolysis in OMOP databases.
PG  - 31

AB  - BACKGROUND: Temporal pattern discovery (TPD) is a method of signal detection 
      using electronic healthcare databases, serving as an alternative to spontaneous 
      reporting of adverse drug events. Here, we aimed to replicate and optimise a TPD 
      approach previously used to assess temporal signals of statins with 
      rhabdomyolysis (in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database) by using the 
      OHDSI tools designed for OMOP data sources. METHODS: We used data from the Truven 
      MarketScan US Commercial Claims and the Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE). 
      Using an extension of the OHDSI ICTemporalPatternDiscovery package, we ran 
      positive and negative controls through four analytical settings and calculated 
      sensitivity, specificity, bias and AUC to assess performance. RESULTS: Similar to 
      previous findings, we noted an increase in the Information Component (IC) for 
      simvastatin and rhabdomyolysis following initial exposure and throughout the 
      surveillance window. For example, the change in IC was 0.266 for the surveillance 
      period of 1-30 days as compared to the control period of - 180 to - 1 days. Our 
      modification of the existing OHDSI software allowed for faster queries and more 
      efficient generation of chronographs. CONCLUSION: Our OMOP replication matched 
      the we can account forwe can account for of the original THIN study, only 
      simvastatin had a signal. The TPD method is a useful signal detection tool that 
      provides a single statistic on temporal association and a graphical depiction of 
      the temporal pattern of the drug outcome combination. It remains unclear if the 
      method works well for rare adverse events, but it has been shown to be a useful 
      risk identification tool for longitudinal observational databases. Future work 
      should compare the performance of TPD with other pharmacoepidemiology methods and 
      mining techniques of signal detection. In addition, it would be worth 
      investigating the relative TPD performance characteristics using a variety of 
      observational data sources.

TI  - Enhancing healthcare process analysis through object-centric process mining: 
      Transforming OMOP common data models into object-centric event logs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to enhance the analysis of healthcare processes by 
      introducing Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM). By offering a holistic 
      perspective that accounts for the interactions among various objects, OCPM 
      transcends the constraints of conventional patient-centric process mining 
      approaches, ensuring a more detailed and inclusive understanding of healthcare 
      dynamics. METHODS: We develop a novel method to transform the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Models (OMOP CDM) into Object-Centric 
      Event Logs (OCELs). First, an OMOP CDM4PM is created from the standard OMOP CDM, 
      focusing on data relevant to generating OCEL and addressing healthcare data's 
      heterogeneity and standardization challenges. Second, this subset is transformed 
      into OCEL based on specified healthcare criteria, including identifying various 
      object types, clinical activities, and their relationships. The methodology is 
      tested on the MIMIC-IV database to evaluate its effectiveness and utility. 
      RESULTS: Our proposed method effectively produces OCELs when applied to the 
      MIMIC-IV dataset, allowing for the implementation of OCPM in the healthcare 
      industry. We rigorously evaluate the comprehensiveness and level of abstraction 
      to validate our approach's effectiveness. Additionally, we create diverse 
      object-centric process models intricately designed to navigate the complexities 
      inherent in healthcare processes. CONCLUSION: Our approach introduces a novel 
      perspective by integrating multiple viewpoints simultaneously. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the inaugural application of OCPM within the healthcare 
      sector, marking a significant advancement in the field.

TI  - [Benefits of large healthcare databases for drug risk research].
PG  - 829-837
LID - 10.1007/s00103-015-2185-7 [doi]
AB  - Large electronic healthcare databases have become an important worldwide data 
      resource for drug safety research after approval. Signal generation methods and 
      drug safety studies based on these data facilitate the prospective monitoring of 
      drug safety after approval, as has been recently required by EU law and the 
      German Medicines Act. Despite its large size, a single healthcare database may 
      include insufficient patients for the study of a very small number of 
      drug-exposed patients or the investigation of very rare drug risks. For that 
      reason, in the United States, efforts have been made to work on models that 
      provide the linkage of data from different electronic healthcare databases for 
      monitoring the safety of medicines after authorization in (i) the Sentinel 
      Initiative and (ii) the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). In 
      July 2014, the pilot project Mini-Sentinel included a total of 178 million people 
      from 18 different US databases. The merging of the data is based on a distributed 
      data network with a common data model. In the European Network of Centres for 
      Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCEPP) there has been no comparable 
      merging of data from different databases; however, first experiences have been 
      gained in various EU drug safety projects. In Germany, the data of the statutory 
      health insurance providers constitute the most important resource for 
      establishing a large healthcare database. Their use for this purpose has so far 
      been severely restricted by the Code of Social Law (Section 75, Book 10). 
      Therefore, a reform of this section is absolutely necessary.

TI  - Identifying factors associated with persistent opioid use after total joint 
      arthroplasty: A retrospective review.
LID - pnae120 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnae120 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of persistent opioid use in opioid-naïve 
      individuals undergoing total joint arthroplasty. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort 
      study. SETTING: Maine Health System. SUBJECTS: Opioid-naïve patients who 
      underwent at least one total joint arthroplasty (knee, hip, or shoulder) between 
      2015 and 2020. METHODS: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
      logistic regression was used to create a predictive model for persistent opioid 
      use after surgery from a US Electronic Health Record dataset in the Observational 
      Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) format. 75% of the 
      data was used to build the LASSO model using 10-fold cross-validation and 25% of 
      the data was used to determine the optimal probability threshold for predicting 
      the binary outcome. RESULTS: Out of 6432 patients, 12.3% (792) were identified as 
      having persistent opioid use across combined total joint arthroplasties defined 
      as at least one opioid prescription between 90 days and one year after surgery. 
      Patients with persistent opioid use were more likely to be current smokers (OR 
      1.65), use antidepressants (OR 1.76), or have a diagnosis of post-traumatic 
      stress disorder (OR 2.07), or a substance related disorder (OR 1.69). Other 
      factors associated with persistent opioid use included back pain (OR 1.43), 
      dementia (OR 1.65), and BMI over 40 (OR 2.50). The probability of persistent 
      opioid use was not associated with age, sex, or ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      predictive model for persistent opioid use after total joint arthroplasty shows 
      promise as an evidence-based, validated, and standardized tool for identifying 
      high-risk patients before surgery in order to target strategies and interventions 
      to reduce the reliance on opioids for post-operative pain control.

TI  - Development of an Interoperable and Easily Transferable Clinical Decision Support 
      System Deployment Platform: System Design and Development Study.
PG  - e37928
LID - 10.2196/37928 [doi]
LID - e37928
AB  - BACKGROUND: A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is recognized as a 
      technology that enhances clinical efficacy and safety. However, its full 
      potential has not been realized, mainly due to clinical data standards and 
      noninteroperable platforms. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we introduce the common 
      data model-based intelligent algorithm network environment (CANE) platform that 
      supports the implementation and deployment of a CDSS. METHODS: CDSS reasoning 
      engines, usually represented as R or Python objects, are deployed into the CANE 
      platform and converted into C# objects. When a clinician requests CANE-based 
      decision support in the electronic health record (EHR) system, patients' 
      information is transformed into Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability 
      Resources (FHIR) format and transmitted to the CANE server inside the hospital 
      firewall. Upon receiving the necessary data, the CANE system's modules perform 
      the following tasks: (1) the preprocessing module converts the FHIRs into the 
      input data required by the specific reasoning engine, (2) the reasoning engine 
      module operates the target algorithms, (3) the integration module communicates 
      with the other institutions' CANE systems to request and transmit a summary 
      report to aid in decision support, and (4) creates a user interface by 
      integrating the summary report and the results calculated by the reasoning 
      engine. RESULTS: We developed a CANE system such that any algorithm implemented 
      in the system can be directly called through the RESTful application programming 
      interface when it is integrated with an EHR system. Eight algorithms were 
      developed and deployed in the CANE system. Using a knowledge-based algorithm, 
      physicians can screen patients who are prone to sepsis and obtain treatment 
      guides for patients with sepsis with the CANE system. Further, using a 
      nonknowledge-based algorithm, the CANE system supports emergency physicians' 
      clinical decisions about optimum resource allocation by predicting a patient's 
      acuity and prognosis during triage. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a 
      common data model-based platform that adheres to medical informatics standards 
      and could aid artificial intelligence model deployment using R or Python.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of administrative claims from multiple sources for research 
      purposes is challenged by the lack of consistency in the structure of the 
      underlying data and definition of data across claims data providers. This paper 
      evaluates the impact of applying a standardized revenue code-based logic for 
      defining inpatient encounters across two different claims databases. METHODS: We 
      selected members who had complete enrollment in 2012 from the Truven MarketScan 
      Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) and the Optum Clinformatics (Optum) 
      databases. The overall prevalence of inpatient conditions in the raw data was 
      compared to that in the common data model (CDM) with the standardized visit 
      definition applied. RESULTS: In CCAE, 87.18% of claims from 2012 that were 
      classified as part of inpatient visits in the raw data were also classified as 
      part of inpatient visits after the data were standardized to CDM, and this 
      overlap was consistent from 2006 to 2011. In contrast, Optum had 83.18% 
      concordance in classification of 2012 claims from inpatient encounters before and 
      after standardization, but the consistency varied over time. The 
      re-classification of inpatient encounters substantially impacted the observed 
      prevalence of medical conditions occurring in the inpatient setting and the 
      consistency in prevalence estimates between the databases. On average, before 
      standardization, each condition in Optum was 12% more prevalent than that same 
      condition in CCAE; after standardization, the prevalence of conditions had a mean 
      difference of only 1% between databases. Amongst 7,039 conditions reviewed, the 
      difference in the prevalence of 67% of conditions in these two databases was 
      reduced after standardization. CONCLUSIONS: In an effort to improve consistency 
      in research results across database one should review sources of database 
      heterogeneity, such as the way data holders process raw claims data. Our study 
      showed that applying the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM 
      with a standardized approach for defining inpatient visits during the extract, 
      transfer, and load process can decrease the heterogeneity observed in disease 
      prevalence estimates across two different claims data sources.

TI  - Interventions and Operations 5 Years After Bariatric Surgery in a Cohort From the 
      US National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network Bariatric Study.
PG  - 194-204
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2019.5470 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Additional data comparing longer-term problems associated with 
      various bariatric surgical procedures are needed for shared decision-making. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the risks of intervention, operation, endoscopy, 
      hospitalization, and mortality up to 5 years after 2 bariatric surgical 
      procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults who underwent Roux-en-Y 
      gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between January 1, 2005, and 
      September 30, 2015, within the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research 
      Network. Data from 33 560 adults at 10 centers within 4 clinical data research 
      networks were included in this cohort study. Information was extracted from 
      electronic health records using a common data model and linked to insurance 
      claims and mortality indices. Analyses were conducted from January 2018 through 
      October 2019. EXPOSURES: Bariatric surgical procedures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was time until operation or intervention. Secondary 
      outcomes included endoscopy, hospitalization, and mortality rates. RESULTS: Of 
      33 560 adults, 18 056 (54%) underwent RYGB, and 15 504 (46%) underwent SG. The 
      median (interquartile range) follow-up for operation or intervention was 3.4 
      (1.6-5.0) years for RYGB and 2.2 (0.9-3.6) years for SG. The overall mean (SD) 
      patient age was 45.0 (11.5) years, and the overall mean (SD) patient body mass 
      index was 49.1 (7.9). The cohort was composed predominantly of women (80%) and 
      white individuals (66%), with 26% of Hispanic ethnicity. Operation or 
      intervention was less likely for SG than for RYGB (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 
      0.65-0.79; P < .001). The estimated, adjusted cumulative incidence rates of 
      operation or intervention at 5 years were 8.94% (95% CI, 8.23%-9.65%) for SG and 
      12.27% (95% CI, 11.49%-13.05%) for RYGB. Hospitalization was less likely for SG 
      than for RYGB (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.87; P < .001), and the 5-year 
      adjusted cumulative incidence rates were 32.79% (95% CI, 31.62%-33.94%) for SG 
      and 38.33% (95% CI, 37.17%-39.46%) for RYGB. Endoscopy was less likely for SG 
      than for RYGB (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.43-0.52; P < .001), and the adjusted 
      cumulative incidence rates at 5 years were 7.80% (95% CI, 7.15%-8.43%) for SG and 
      15.83% (95% CI, 14.94%-16.71%) for RYGB. There were no differences in all-cause 
      mortality between SG and RYGB. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Interventions, 
      operations, and hospitalizations were relatively common after bariatric surgical 
      procedures and were more often associated with RYGB than SG. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Trends in Antidiabetic Drug Use and Safety of Metformin in Diabetic Patients with 
      Varying Degrees of Chronic Kidney Disease from 2010 to 2021 in Korea: 
      Retrospective Cohort Study Using the Common Data Model.
LID - 10.3390/ph17101369 [doi]
LID - 1369
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate trends in antidiabetic 
      drug use and assess the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: A retrospective 
      observational analysis based on the common data model was conducted using 
      electronic medical records from 2010 to 2021. The patients included were aged 
      ≥18, diagnosed with CKD and type 2 diabetes, and had received antidiabetic 
      medications for ≥30 days. MALA was defined as pH ≤ 7.35 and arterial lactate ≥4 
      mmol/L. RESULTS: A total of 8318 patients were included, with 6185 in CKD stages 
      1-2 and 2133 in stages 3a-5. Metformin monotherapy was the most prescribed 
      regimen, except in stage 5 CKD. As CKD progressed, metformin use significantly 
      declined; insulin and meglitinides were most frequently prescribed in end-stage 
      renal disease. Over the study period, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors (13.3%) and 
      DPP-4 inhibitors (24.5%) increased significantly, while sulfonylurea use 
      decreased (p < 0.05). Metformin use remained stable in earlier CKD stages but 
      significantly decreased in stage 3b or worse. The incidence rate (IR) of MALA was 
      1.22 per 1000 patient-years, with a significantly increased IR in stage 4 or 
      worse CKD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin was the most prescribed 
      antidiabetic drug in CKD patients in Korea with a low risk of MALA. Antidiabetic 
      drug use patterns varied across CKD stages, with a notable decline in metformin 
      use in advanced CKD and a rise in SGLT2 inhibitor prescriptions, underscoring the 
      need for further optimized therapy.

TI  - OntoBridge Versus Traditional ETL: Enhancing Data Standardization into CDM 
      Formats Using Ontologies Within the DATOS-CAT Project.
PG  - 1432-1436
LID - 10.3233/SHTI240681 [doi]
AB  - Common Data Models (CDMs) enhance data exchange and integration across diverse 
      sources, preserving semantics and context. Transforming local data into CDMs is 
      typically cumbersome and resource-intensive, with limited reusability. This 
      article compares OntoBridge, an ontology-based tool designed to streamline the 
      conversion of local datasets into CDMs, with traditional ETL methods in adopting 
      the OMOP CDM. We examine flexibility and scalability in the management of new 
      data sources, CDM updates, and the adoption of new CDMs. OntoBridge showed 
      greater flexibility in integrating new data sources and adapting to CDM updates. 
      It was also more scalable, facilitating the adoption of various CDMs like i2b2, 
      unlike traditional methods reliant on OMOP-specific tools developed by OHDSI. In 
      summary, while traditional ETL provides a structured approach to data 
      integration, OntoBridge offers a more flexible, scalable, and 
      maintenance-efficient alternative.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI240748 [doi]
AB  - Multicentre studies become possible with the current strategies to solve the 
      interoperability problems between databases. With the great adoption of those 
      strategies, new problems regarding data discovery were raised. Some were solved 
      using database catalogues and graphical dashboards for data analysis and 
      comparison. However, when these communities grow, these strategies become 
      obsolete. In this work, we addressed those challenges by proposing a platform 
      with a chatbot-like mechanism to help medical researchers identify databases of 
      interest. The tool was developed using the metadata extracted from OMOP CDM 
      databases.

TI  - Transformer-based time-to-event prediction for chronic kidney disease 
      deterioration.
PG  - 980-990
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocae025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deep-learning techniques, particularly the Transformer model, have 
      shown great potential in enhancing the prediction performance of longitudinal 
      health records. Previous methods focused on fixed-time risk prediction, however, 
      time-to-event prediction is often more appropriate for clinical scenarios. Here, 
      we present STRAFE, a generalizable survival analysis Transformer-based 
      architecture for electronic health records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input for 
      STRAFE is a sequence of visits with SNOMED-CT codes in OMOP-CDM format. A 
      Transformer-based architecture was developed to calculate probabilities of the 
      occurrence of the event in each of 48 months. Performance was evaluated using a 
      real-world claims dataset of over 130 000 individuals with stage 3 chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). RESULTS: STRAFE showed improved mean absolute error (MAE) compared 
      to other time-to-event algorithms in predicting the time to deterioration to 
      stage 5 CKD. Additionally, STRAFE showed an improved area under the receiver 
      operating curve compared to binary outcome algorithms. We show that STRAFE 
      predictions can improve the positive predictive value of high-risk patients by 
      3-fold. Finally, we suggest a novel visualization approach to predictions on a 
      per-patient basis. DISCUSSION: Time-to-event predictions are the most appropriate 
      approach for clinical predictions. Our deep-learning algorithm outperformed not 
      only other time-to-event prediction algorithms but also fixed-time algorithms, 
      possibly due to its ability to train on censored data. We demonstrated possible 
      clinical usage by identifying the highest-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: The ability 
      to accurately identify patients at high risk and prioritize their needs can 
      result in improved health outcomes, reduced costs, and more efficient use of 
      resources.

TI  - Use of dialysis, tracheostomy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation among 
      842,928 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who 
      undergo dialysis, tracheostomy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 
      DESIGN: A network cohort study. SETTING: Seven databases from the United States 
      containing routinely-collected patient data: HealthVerity, Premier, IQVIA 
      Hospital CDM, IQVIA Open Claims, Optum EHR, Optum SES, and VA-OMOP. PATIENTS: 
      Patients hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis or a positive test result for 
      COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Dialysis, tracheostomy, and ECMO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: 842,928 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included (22,887 from 
      HealthVerity, 77,853 from IQVIA Hospital CDM, 533,997 from IQVIA Open Claims, 
      36,717 from Optum EHR, 4,336 from OPTUM SES, 156,187 from Premier, and 10,951 
      from VA-OMOP). Across the six databases, 35,192 (4.17% [95% CI: 4.13% to 4.22%]) 
      patients received dialysis, 6,950 (0.82% [0.81% to 0.84%]) had a tracheostomy, 
      and 1,568 (0.19% [95% CI: 0.18% to 0.20%]) patients underwent ECMO over the 30 
      days following hospitalization. Use of ECMO was more common among patients who 
      were younger, male, and with fewer comorbidities. Tracheostomy was broadly used 
      for a similar proportion of patients regardless of age, sex, or comorbidity. 
      While dialysis was generally used for a similar proportion among younger and 
      older patients, it was more frequent among male patients and among those with 
      chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: Use of dialysis among those hospitalized with 
      COVID-19 is high at around 4%. Although less than one percent of patients undergo 
      tracheostomy and ECMO, the absolute numbers of patients who have undergone these 
      interventions is substantial.

TI  - Developing a clinical decision support system software prototype that assists in 
      the management of patients with self-harm in the emergency department: protocol 
      of the PERMANENS project.
PG  - 220
LID - 10.1186/s12888-024-05659-6 [doi]
LID - 220
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-harm presents a significant public health challenge. Emergency 
      departments (EDs) are crucial healthcare settings in managing self-harm, but 
      clinician uncertainty in risk assessment may contribute to ineffective care. 
      Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) show promise in enhancing care 
      processes, but their effective implementation in self-harm management remains 
      unexplored. METHODS: PERMANENS comprises a combination of methodologies and study 
      designs aimed at developing a CDSS prototype that assists clinicians in the 
      personalized assessment and management of ED patients presenting with self-harm. 
      Ensemble prediction models will be constructed by applying machine learning 
      techniques on electronic registry data from four sites, i.e., Catalonia (Spain), 
      Ireland, Norway, and Sweden. These models will predict key adverse outcomes 
      including self-harm repetition, suicide, premature death, and lack of 
      post-discharge care. Available registry data include routinely collected 
      electronic health record data, mortality data, and administrative data, and will 
      be harmonized using the OMOP Common Data Model, ensuring consistency in 
      terminologies, vocabularies and coding schemes. A clinical knowledge base of 
      effective suicide prevention interventions will be developed rooted in a 
      systematic review of clinical practice guidelines, including quality assessment 
      of guidelines using the AGREE II tool. The CDSS software prototype will include a 
      backend that integrates the prediction models and the clinical knowledge base to 
      enable accurate patient risk stratification and subsequent intervention 
      allocation. The CDSS frontend will enable personalized risk assessment and will 
      provide tailored treatment plans, following a tiered evidence-based approach. 
      Implementation research will ensure the CDSS' practical functionality and 
      feasibility, and will include periodic meetings with user-advisory groups, 
      mixed-methods research to identify currently unmet needs in self-harm risk 
      assessment, and small-scale usability testing of the CDSS prototype software. 
      DISCUSSION: Through the development of the proposed CDSS software prototype, 
      PERMANENS aims to standardize care, enhance clinician confidence, improve patient 
      satisfaction, and increase treatment compliance. The routine integration of CDSS 
      for self-harm risk assessment within healthcare systems holds significant 
      potential in effectively reducing suicide mortality rates by facilitating 
      personalized and timely delivery of effective interventions on a large scale for 
      individuals at risk of suicide.

TI  - Towards global model generalizability: independent cross-site feature evaluation 
      for patient-level risk prediction models using the OHDSI network.
PG  - 1051-1061

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predictive models show promise in healthcare, but their successful 
      deployment is challenging due to limited generalizability. Current external 
      validation often focuses on model performance with restricted feature use from 
      the original training data, lacking insights into their suitability at external 
      sites. Our study introduces an innovative methodology for evaluating features 
      during both the development phase and the validation, focusing on creating and 
      validating predictive models for post-surgery patient outcomes with improved 
      generalizability. METHODS: Electronic health records (EHRs) from 4 countries 
      (United States, United Kingdom, Finland, and Korea) were mapped to the OMOP 
      Common Data Model (CDM), 2008-2019. Machine learning (ML) models were developed 
      to predict post-surgery prolonged opioid use (POU) risks using data collected 6 
      months before surgery. Both local and cross-site feature selection methods were 
      applied in the development and external validation datasets. Models were 
      developed using Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tools 
      and validated on separate patient cohorts. RESULTS: Model development included 
      41 929 patients, 14.6% with POU. The external validation included 31 932 (UK), 
      23 100 (US), 7295 (Korea), and 3934 (Finland) patients with POU of 44.2%, 22.0%, 
      15.8%, and 21.8%, respectively. The top-performing model, Lasso logistic 
      regression, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUROC) of 0.75 during local validation and 0.69 (SD = 0.02) (averaged) in 
      external validation. Models trained with cross-site feature selection 
      significantly outperformed those using only features from the development site 
      through external validation (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Using EHRs across four 
      countries mapped to the OMOP CDM, we developed generalizable predictive models 
      for POU. Our approach demonstrates the significant impact of cross-site feature 
      selection in improving model performance, underscoring the importance of 
      incorporating diverse feature sets from various clinical settings to enhance the 
      generalizability and utility of predictive healthcare models.

TI  - A large, multi-center survey assessing health, social support, literacy, and 
      self-management resources in patients with heart failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with heart failure (HF) have multimorbidity which may 
      cause difficulties with self-management. Understanding the resources patients 
      draw upon to effectively manage their health is fundamental to designing new 
      practice models to improve outcomes in HF. We describe the rationale, conceptual 
      framework, and implementation of a multi-center survey of HF patients, 
      characterize differences between responders and non-responders, and summarize 
      patient characteristics and responses to the survey constructs among responders. 
      METHODS: This was a multi-center cross-sectional survey study with linked 
      electronic health record (EHR) data. Our survey was guided by the Chronic Care 
      Model to understand the distribution of patient-centric factors, including health 
      literacy, social support, self-management, and functional and mental status in 
      patients with HF. Most questions were from existing validated questionnaires. The 
      survey was administered to HF patients aged ≥ 30 years from 4 health systems in 
      PCORnet® (the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network): Essentia 
      Health, Intermountain Health, Mayo Clinic, and The Ohio State University. Each 
      health system mapped their EHR data to a standardized PCORnet Common Data Model, 
      which was used to extract demographic and clinical data on survey responders and 
      non-responders. RESULTS: Across the 4 sites, 10,662 patients with HF were invited 
      to participate, and 3330 completed the survey (response rate: 31%). Responders 
      were older (74 vs. 71 years; standardized difference (95% CI): 0.18 (0.13, 
      0.22)), less racially diverse (3% vs. 12% non-White; standardized difference (95% 
      CI): -0.32 (-0.36, -0.28)), and had higher prevalence of many chronic conditions 
      than non-responders, and thus may not be representative of all HF patients. The 
      internal reliability of the validated questionnaires in our survey was good 
      (range of Cronbach's alpha: 0.50-0.96). Responders reported their health was 
      generally good or fair, they frequently had cardiovascular comorbidities, > 50% 
      had difficulty climbing stairs, and > 10% reported difficulties with bathing, 
      preparing meals, and using transportation. Nearly 80% of patients had family or 
      friends sit with them during a doctor visit, and 54% managed their health by 
      themselves. Patients reported generally low perceived support for self-management 
      related to exercise and diet. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of patients with HF 
      managed their health by themselves. Increased understanding of self-management 
      resources may guide the development of interventions to improve HF outcomes.

TI  - A Semantic Transformation Methodology for the Secondary Use of Observational 
      Healthcare Data in Postmarketing Safety Studies.
PG  - 435
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2018.00435 [doi]
LID - 435
AB  - Background: Utilization of the available observational healthcare datasets is key 
      to complement and strengthen the postmarketing safety studies. Use of common data 
      models (CDM) is the predominant approach in order to enable large scale 
      systematic analyses on disparate data models and vocabularies. Current CDM 
      transformation practices depend on proprietarily developed Extract-Transform-Load 
      (ETL) procedures, which require knowledge both on the semantics and technical 
      characteristics of the source datasets and target CDM. Purpose: In this study, 
      our aim is to develop a modular but coordinated transformation approach in order 
      to separate semantic and technical steps of transformation processes, which do 
      not have a strict separation in traditional ETL approaches. Such an approach 
      would discretize the operations to extract data from source electronic health 
      record systems, alignment of the source, and target models on the semantic level 
      and the operations to populate target common data repositories. Approach: In 
      order to separate the activities that are required to transform heterogeneous 
      data sources to a target CDM, we introduce a semantic transformation approach 
      composed of three steps: (1) transformation of source datasets to Resource 
      Description Framework (RDF) format, (2) application of semantic conversion rules 
      to get the data as instances of ontological model of the target CDM, and (3) 
      population of repositories, which comply with the specifications of the CDM, by 
      processing the RDF instances from step 2. The proposed approach has been 
      implemented on real healthcare settings where Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) CDM has been chosen as the common data model and a 
      comprehensive comparative analysis between the native and transformed data has 
      been conducted. Results: Health records of ~1 million patients have been 
      successfully transformed to an OMOP CDM based database from the source database. 
      Descriptive statistics obtained from the source and target databases present 
      analogous and consistent results. Discussion and Conclusion: Our method goes 
      beyond the traditional ETL approaches by being more declarative and rigorous. 
      Declarative because the use of RDF based mapping rules makes each mapping more 
      transparent and understandable to humans while retaining logic-based 
      computability. Rigorous because the mappings would be based on computer readable 
      semantics which are amenable to validation through logic-based inference methods.

AB  - Predicting resource utilization can help to optimize the distribution of limited 
      resources in the healthcare system. This requires different climatic and medical 
      data from different sources, which can lead to problems with interoperability. In 
      the paper we describe which data is needed for the prediction and how the data 
      can be made interoperable using OMOP CDM.

TI  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care utilization among 
      people living with HIV: A real-world data study.
LID - 2024.09.26.24314443 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2024.09.26.24314443 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted mental health worldwide, 
      particularly among vulnerable populations such as people living with HIV (PLWH). 
      However, large-scale, real-world data on mental health care utilization and 
      associated factors among PLWH remain limited. This study leveraged electronic 
      health records (EHR) and Basics survey data from the All of Us program to explore 
      mental health care utilization and associated factors among PLWH during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified 
      and included 4,575 PLWH through computational phenotyping based on relevant 
      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) concept 
      sets from the All of Us program between March 2018 and March 2022. Mental health 
      care utilization was measured using the yearly count of mental health care visits 
      over this period. The pattern of mental health care utilization was compared 
      between pre-pandemic (2018-2020) and during the pandemic (2020-2022). Incidence 
      rate ratios (IRR) from the Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were 
      used to examine associations between mental health care utilization, history of 
      COVID-19 infection, demographic factors, pre-existing chronic conditions (e.g., 
      hypertension, diabetes), and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Among 4,575 PLWH, the 
      annual number of mental health care visits decreased significantly during the 
      pandemic period (March 2020 - March 2022) compared to the pre-pandemic period 
      (March 2018 - February 2020) (IRR = 0.89, p < 0.001). The Poisson regression 
      analysis found that a history of COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher 
      number of mental health care visits (IRR = 1.35, p < 0.001). Middle-aged groups 
      with participants aged 30-39 (IRR= 2.35, p = 0.002), 40-49 (IRR= 3.49, p < 
      0.001), and 50-64 (IRR= 2.07, p = 0.004) had significantly higher visit numbers 
      compared to the youngest group (18-29 years). Black or African American 
      participants were less likely to have visits compared to White participants (IRR 
      = 0.71, p = 0.002). Medicaid health insurance was associated with an increase 
      (IRR = 1.29, p = 0.007), while employer- or union-sponsored insurance was 
      associated with a decrease in mental health care utilization (IRR = 0.54, p < 
      0.001, p < 0.001). Pre-existing comorbidities greatly increased the number of 
      mental health care visits (one comorbidity: IRR = 5.49, two or more: IRR = 10.4, 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a significant decrease in mental health 
      care utilization and the diverse experiences of mental healthcare among PLWH 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings underscore the importance of 
      addressing disparities in mental health care access, particularly during public 
      health emergencies, and suggest the need for tailored interventions to meet the 
      mental health care needs of PLWH.
