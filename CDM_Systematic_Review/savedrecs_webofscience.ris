AB  - Austria's national Electronic Health Record (EHR) system holds information on medication prescriptions and dispenses in highly structured HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents. Making these data accessible for research is desirable due to their volume and completeness. This work describes our approach of transforming the HL7 CDA data into Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and highlights a key challenge, namely mapping the Austrian drug terminology to OMOP standard concepts.

AB  - Background: Implementing clinical phenotypes across a network is labor intensive and potentially error prone. Use of a common data model may facilitate the process.
   Methods: Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) sites implemented the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model across their electronic health record (EHR)-linked DNA biobanks. Two previously implemented eMERGE phenotypes were converted to OMOP and implemented across the network.
   Results: It was feasible to implement the common data model across sites, with laboratory data producing the greatest challenge due to local encoding. Sites were then able to execute the OMOP phenotype in less than one day, as opposed to weeks of effort to manually implement an eMERGE phenotype in their bespoke research EHR databases. Of the sites that could compare the current OMOP phenotype implementation with the original eMERGE phenotype implementation, specific agreement ranged from 100% to 43%, with disagreements due to the original phenotype, the OMOP phenotype, changes in data, and issues in the databases. Using the OMOP query as a standard comparison revealed differences in the original implementations despite starting from the same definitions, code lists, flowcharts, and pseudocode.
   Conclusion: Using a common data model can dramatically speed phenotype implementation at the cost of having to populate that data model, though this will produce a net benefit as the number of phenotype implementations increases. Inconsistencies among the implementations of the original queries point to a potential benefit of using a common data model so that actual phenotype code and logic can be shared, mitigating human error in reinterpretation of a narrative phenotype definition.

KW  - common data model
AB  - Introduction: Electronic health record (EHR) data have emerged as an important resource for population health and clinical research. There have been significant efforts to leverage EHR data for research; however, given data security concerns and the complexity of the data, EHR data are frequently difficult to access and use for clinical studies. We describe the development of a Clinical Research Datamart (CRDM) that was developed to provide well-curated and easily accessible EHR data to Duke University investigators. Methods: The CRDM was designed to (1) contain most of the patient-level data elements needed for research studies; (2) be directly accessible by individuals conducting statistical analyses (including Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) core members); (3) be queried via a code-based system to promote reproducibility and consistency across studies; and (4) utilize a secure protected analytic workspace in which sensitive EHR data can be stored and analyzed. The CRDM utilizes data transformed for the PCORnet data network, and was augmented with additional data tables containing site-specific data elements to provide additional contextual information. Results: We provide descriptions of ideal use cases and discuss dissemination and evaluation methods, including future work to expand the user base and track the use and impact of this data resource. Conclusions: The CRDM utilizes resources developed as part of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) program and could be replicated by other institutions with CTSAs.

AB  - Objectives In this overview, we describe theObservational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), the established governance processes employed in EMR data repositories, and demonstrate how OMOP transformed data provides a lever for more efficient and secure access to electronic medical record (EMR) data by health service providers and researchers.Methods Through pseudonymisation and common data quality assessments, the OMOP-CDM provides a robust framework for converting complex EMR data into a standardised format. This allows for the creation of shared end-to-end analysis packages without the need for direct data exchange, thereby enhancing data security and privacy. By securely sharing de-identified and aggregated data and conducting analyses across multiple OMOP-converted databases, patient-level data is securely firewalled within its respective local site.Results By simplifying data management processes and governance, and through the promotion of interoperability, the OMOP-CDM supports a wide range of clinical, epidemiological, and translational research projects, as well as health service operational reporting.Discussion Adoption of the OMOP-CDM internationally and locally enables conversion of vast amounts of complex, and heterogeneous EMR data into a standardised structured data model, simplifies governance processes, and facilitates rapid repeatable cross-institution analysis through shared end-to-end analysis packages, without the sharing of data.Conclusion The adoption of the OMOP-CDM has the potential to transform health data analytics by providing a common platform for analysing EMR data across diverse healthcare settings.

AB  - Purpose: Quetiapine is a drug used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. However, it can cause mild or severe hepatic adverse events and rarely fatal liver damage. This study was aimed at investigating hepatic toxicity caused by quetiapine use by analyzing the information captured from hospital electronic health records by using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (CDM).
   Methods: This was a retrospective observational study involving a nested case-control method. A CDM based on an electronic health record database from five hospitals between January 2009 and May 2020 was used. We analyzed the status of quetiapine use, adverse events, and hepatic impairment.
   Results: The numbers of patients with non-serious and severe hepatic adverse reactions were 2566 (5.05%) and 835 (1.64%) out of 50 766 patients, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratio of hepatic adverse events was 2.35 (95% CI: 2.03-2.72), and the odds ratio of severe hepatic adverse events was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.16-2.66).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that quetiapine should be cautiously used, and hepatic function should be monitored in patients using quetiapine because it can cause mild or severe hepatic adverse events, complications, and in rare cases, fatal liver damage.

AB  - Objectives The Multi-State EHR-Based Network for Disease Surveillance (MENDS) is a population-based chronic disease surveillance distributed data network that uses institution-specific extraction-transformation-load (ETL) routines. MENDS-on-FHIR examined using Health Language Seven's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 (R) FHIR (R)) and US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG) compliant resources derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to create a standards-based ETL pipeline.Materials and Methods The input data source was a research data warehouse containing clinical and administrative data in OMOP CDM Version 5.3 format. OMOP-to-FHIR transformations, using a unique JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-to-JSON transformation language called Whistle, created FHIR R4 V4.0.1/US Core IG V4.0.0 conformant resources that were stored in a local FHIR server. A REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request extracted FHIR resources to populate a local MENDS database.Results Eleven OMOP tables were used to create 10 FHIR/US Core compliant resource types. A total of 1.13 trillion resources were extracted and inserted into the MENDS repository. A very low rate of non-compliant resources was observed.Discussion OMOP-to-FHIR transformation results passed validation with less than a 1% non-compliance rate. These standards-compliant FHIR resources provided standardized data elements required by the MENDS surveillance use case. The Bulk FHIR application programming interface (API) enabled population-level data exchange using interoperable FHIR resources. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformation pipeline creates a FHIR interface for accessing OMOP data.Conclusion MENDS-on-FHIR successfully replaced custom ETL with standards-based interoperable FHIR resources using Bulk FHIR. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformations provide an alternative mechanism for sharing OMOP data.
   Many chronic conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are becoming more prevalent, especially in high-risk individuals, such as minorities and low-income patients. Public health surveillance networks measure the presence of specific conditions repeatedly over time, seeking to detect changes in the amount of a disease conditions so that public health officials can implement new early prevention programs or evaluate the impact of an existing prevention program. Data stored in electronic health records (EHRs) could be used to measure the presence of health conditions, but significant technical barriers make current methods for data extraction laborious and costly. HL7 Bulk FHIR is a new data standard that is required to be available in all commercial EHR systems in the United States. We examined the use of Bulk FHIR to provide EHR data to an existing public health surveillance network called MENDS. We found that HL7 Bulk FHIR can provide the necessary data elements for MENDS in a standardized format. Using HL7 Bulk FHIR could significantly reduce barriers to data for public health surveillance needs, enabling public health officials to expand the diversity of locations and patient populations being monitored.

AB  - Objective: Feature engineering is a major bottleneck in phenotyping. Properly learned medical concept embeddings (MCEs) capture the semantics of medical concepts, thus are useful for retrieving relevant medical features in phenotyping tasks. We compared the effectiveness of MCEs learned from knowledge graphs and electronic healthcare records (EHR) data in retrieving relevant medical features for phenotyping tasks.
   Materials and Methods: We implemented 5 embedding methods including node2vec, singular value decomposition (SVD), LINE, skip-gram, and GloVe with 2 data sources: (1) knowledge graphs obtained from the observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data model; and (2) patient-level data obtained from the OMOP compatible electronic health records (EHR) from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). We used phenotypes with their relevant concepts developed and validated by the electronic medical records and genomics (eMERGE) network to evaluate the performance of learned MCEs in retrieving phenotyperelevant concepts. Hits@k% in retrieving phenotype-relevant concepts based on a single and multiple seed concept(s) was used to evaluate MCEs.
   Results: Among all MCEs, MCEs learned by using node2vec with knowledge graphs showed the best performance. Of MCEs based on knowledge graphs and EHR data, MCEs learned by using node2vec with knowledge graphs and MCEs learned by using GloVe with EHR data outperforms other MCEs, respectively.
   Conclusion: MCE enables scalable feature engineering tasks, thereby facilitating phenotyping. Based on current phenotyping practices, MCEs learned by using knowledge graphs constructed by hierarchical relationships among medical concepts outperformed MCEs learned by using EHR data.

AB  - Objective To describe the reusable transformation process of electronic health records (EHR), claims, and prescriptions data into Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), together with challenges faced and solutions implemented.Materials and Methods We used Estonian national health databases that store almost all residents' claims, prescriptions, and EHR records. To develop and demonstrate the transformation process of Estonian health data to OMOP CDM, we used a 10% random sample of the Estonian population (n = 150 824 patients) from 2012 to 2019 (MAITT dataset). For the sample, complete information from all 3 databases was converted to OMOP CDM version 5.3. The validation was performed using open-source tools.Results In total, we transformed over 100 million entries to standard concepts using standard OMOP vocabularies with the average mapping rate 95%. For conditions, observations, drugs, and measurements, the mapping rate was over 90%. In most cases, SNOMED Clinical Terms were used as the target vocabulary.Discussion During the transformation process, we encountered several challenges, which are described in detail with concrete examples and solutions.Conclusion For a representative 10% random sample, we successfully transferred complete records from 3 national health databases to OMOP CDM and created a reusable transformation process. Our work helps future researchers to transform linked databases into OMOP CDM more efficiently, ultimately leading to better real-world evidence.
   Health data can be found in various sources and formats, making it challenging for researchers. To address this issue, one possible approach is to transform the data into a standardized common data model (CDM). In this study, we describe the process of converting electronic health records (EHR), claims, and prescriptions data into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) CDM, along with the challenges faced and solutions implemented. We used Estonian national health databases containing information on claims, prescriptions, and EHR records of 10% of Estonian residents (MAITT dataset). The study describes how data were mapped to standardized vocabulary and successfully converted to the OMOP CDM. We discuss the encountered difficulties and problems and propose solutions to help future researchers transform linked databases into OMOP CDM more efficiently, leading to better real-world evidence.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to transform a resource of linked electronic health records (EHR) to the OMOP common data model (CDM) and evaluate the process in terms of syntactic and semantic consistency and quality when implementing disease and risk factor phenotyping algorithms.
   Materials and Methods: Using heart failure (HF) as an exemplar, we represented three national EHR sources (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care, Office for National Statistics) into the OMOP CDM 5.2. We compared the original and CDM HF patient population by calculating and presenting descriptive statistics of demographics, related comorbidities, and relevant clinical biomarkers.
   Results: We identified a cohort of 502 536 patients with the incident and prevalent HF and converted 1 099 195 384 rows of data from 216 581 914 encounters across three EHR sources to the OMOP CDM. The largest percentage (65%) of unmapped events was related to medication prescriptions in primary care. The average coverage of source vocabularies was >98% with the exception of laboratory tests recorded in primary care. The raw and transformed data were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities with the largest difference observed being 3.78% in the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can successfully be applied to convert EHR linked across multiple healthcare settings and represent phenotyping algorithms spanning multiple sources. Similar to previous research, challenges mapping primary care prescriptions and laboratory measurements still persist and require further work. The use of OMOP CDM in national UK EHR is a valuable research tool that can enable large-scale reproducible observational research.

AB  - Rapid increase in the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal cohort datasets for clinical studies. However, there is a growing need to ensure data traceability, validity, and reproducibility for EHR-based clinical research. Applying common data models that standardize EHR data elements could reduce research discrepancies and improve research reproducibility. As a pilot study, we utilized the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community to annotate cohort data elements from the local Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP). We evaluated the data coverage of the OMOP CDM by manually annotating the cohorts from 92 REP publications. Next, we examined cohort similarities between different publications using OMOP elements. Evaluation results showed that the OMOP CDM covers 99.8% of the content that is associated with cohort attributes. It demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can be used for data element standardization when extracting information from EHR and clinical registries. The OMOP CDM also shows its potential to be used as a tool for retrospective examination of cohort definition consistencies and epidemiology model similarities.

AB  - Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important public health concern in Singapore and places a massive burden on health care spending. Tackling chronic diseases such as DM requires innovative strategies to integrate patients' data from diverse sources and use scientific discovery to inform clinical practice that can help better manage the disease. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) was chosen as the framework for integrating data with disparate formats.
   Objective The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of converting Singapore based data source, comprising of electronic health records (EHR), cognitive and depression assessment questionnaire data to OMOP CDM standard. Additionally, we also validate whether our OMOP CDM instance is fit for the purpose of research by executing a simple treatment pathways study using Atlas, a graphical user interface tool to conduct analysis on OMOP CDM data as a proof of concept.
   Methods We used de-identified EHR, cognitive, and depression assessment questionnaires data from a tertiary care hospital in Singapore to convert it to version 5.3.1 of OMOP CDM standard. We evaluate the OMOP CDM conversion by (1) assessing the mapping coverage (that is the percentage of source terms mapped to OMOP CDM standard); (2) local raw dataset versus CDM dataset analysis; and (3) Implementing Harmonized Intrinsic Data Quality Framework using an open-source R package called Data Quality Dashboard.
   Results The content coverage of OMOP CDM vocabularies is more than 90% for clinical data, but only around 11% for questionnaire data. The comparison of characteristics between source and target data returned consistent results and our transformed data did not pass 38 (1.4%) out of 2,622 quality checks.
   Conclusion Adoption of OMOP CDM at our site demonstrated that EHR data are feasible for standardization with minimal information loss, whereas challenges remain for standardizing cognitive and depression assessment questionnaire data that requires further work.

AB  - The increasing use of electronic health records (EHRs) in veterinary medicine creates an opportunity to utilize the high volume of electronic patient data for mining and data-driven analytics with the goal of improving patient care and outcomes. A central focus of the Clinical and Translational Science Award One Health Alliance (COHA) is to integrate efforts across multiple disciplines to better understand shared diseases in animals and people. The ability to combine veterinary and human medical data provides a unique resource to study the interactions and relationships between animals, humans, and the environment. However, to effectively answer these questions, veterinary EHR data must first be prepared in the same way it is now commonly being done in human medicine to enable data mining and development of analytics to facilitate knowledge formation and solutions that advance our understanding of disease processes, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for veterinary patients and their owners. As a first step, COHA member institutions implemented a Common Data Model to standardize EHR data. Herein we present the approach executed within the COHA framework to prepare and optimize veterinary EHRs for data mining and knowledge formation based on the adoption of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model.

AB  - The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy using the common data model (CDM) based on electronic health record (EHR) data. We also aimed to reveal whether CDM analysis was feasible and applicable to epilepsy research. We analyzed the treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy patients from our institute who underwent antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment for at least 2 years, using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM. Subgroup analysis was performed for generalized or focal epilepsy, varying age of epilepsy onset, and specific epilepsy syndromes. Changes in annual prescription patterns were also analyzed to reveal the different trends. We also calculated the proportion of drug-resistant epilepsy by applying the definition of seizure persistence after application of two ASMs for a sufficient period of time (more than 6 months). We identified 1,192 patients who underwent treatment for more than 2 years (mean +/- standard deviation: 6.5 +/- 3.2 years). In our pediatric epilepsy cohort, we identified 313 different treatment pathways. Drug resistance, calculated as the application of more than three ASMs during the first 2 years of treatment, was 23.8%. Treatment pathways and ASM resistance differed between subgroups of generalized vs. focal epilepsy, different onset age of epilepsy, and specific epilepsy syndromes. The frequency of ASM prescription was similar between onset groups of different ages; however, phenobarbital was frequently used in children with epilepsy onset < 4 years. Ninety-one of 344 cases of generalized epilepsy and 187 of 835 cases of focal epilepsy were classified as medically intractable epilepsy. The percentage of drug resistance was markedly different depending on the specific electro-clinical epilepsy syndrome [79.0% for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), 7.1% for childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and 9.0% for benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS)]. We could visualize the annual trend and changes of ASM prescription for pediatric epilepsy in our institute from 2004 to 2017. We revealed that CDM analysis was feasible and applicable for epilepsy research. The strengths and limitations of CDM analysis should be carefully considered when planning the analysis, result extraction, and interpretation of results.

AB  - Objective: Electronic health records are increasingly utilized for observational and clinical research. Identification of cohorts using electronic health records is an important step in this process. Previous studies largely focused on the methods of cohort selection, but there is little evidence on the impact of underlying vocabularies and mappings between vocabularies used for cohort selection. We aim to compare the cohort selection performance using Australian Medicines Terminology to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) mappings from 2 different sources. These mappings were taken from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) schedule.
   Materials and Methods: We retrieved patients from the electronic Practice Based Research Network data repository using 3 ATC classification groups (A10, N02A, N06A). The retrieved patients were further verified manually and pooled to form a reference standard which was used to assess the accuracy of mappings using precision, recall, and F measure metrics.
   Results: The OMOP-CDM mappings identified 2.6%, 15.2%, and 24.4% more drugs than the PBS mappings in the A10, N02A and N06A groups respectively. Despite this, the PBS mappings generally performed the same in cohort selection as OMOP-CDM mappings except for the N02A Opioids group, where a significantly greater number of patients were retrieved. Both mappings exhibited variable recall, but perfect precision, with all drugs found to be correctly identified.
   Conclusion: We found that 1 of the 3 ATC groups had a significant difference and this affected cohort selection performance. Our findings highlighted that underlying terminology mappings can greatly impact cohort selection accuracy. Clinical researchers should carefully evaluate vocabulary mapping sources including methodologies used to develop those mappings.

AB  - The adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has created opportunities to analyse historical data for predicting clinical outcomes and improving patient care. However, non-standardised data representations and anomalies pose major challenges to the use of EHRs in digital health research. To address these challenges, we have developed EHR-QC, a tool comprising two modules: the data standardisation module and the preprocessing module. The data standardisation module migrates source EHR data to a standard format using advanced concept mapping techniques, surpassing expert curation in benchmarking analysis. The preprocessing module includes several functions designed specifically to handle healthcare data subtleties. We provide automated detection of data anomalies and solutions to handle those anomalies. We believe that the development and adoption of tools like EHR-QC is critical for advancing digital health. Our ultimate goal is to accelerate clinical research by enabling rapid experimentation with data-driven observational research to generate robust, generalisable biomedical knowledge.

AB  - Background:Electronic health record (EHR) data have many quality problems that may affect the outcome of research results and decision support systems. Many methods have been used to evaluate EHR data quality. However, there has yet to be a consensus on the best practice. We used a rule-based approach to assess the variability of EHR data quality across multiple healthcare systems. Methods:To quantify data quality concerns across healthcare systems in a PCORnet Clinical Research Network, we used a previously tested rule-based framework tailored to the PCORnet Common Data Model to perform data quality assessment at 13 clinical sites across eight states. Results were compared with the current PCORnet data curation process to explore the differences between both methods. Additional analyses of testosterone therapy prescribing were used to explore clinical care variability and quality. Results:The framework detected discrepancies across sites, revealing evident data quality variability between sites. The detailed requirements encoded the rules captured additional data errors with a specificity that aids in remediation of technical errors compared to the current PCORnet data curation process. Other rules designed to detect logical and clinical inconsistencies may also support clinical care variability and quality programs. Conclusion:Rule-based EHR data quality methods quantify significant discrepancies across all sites. Medication and laboratory sources are causes of data errors.

AB  - Information Technology (IT) and specialized systems could have a prominent role towards the support of drug safety processes, both in the clinical context but also beyond that. PVClinical project aims to build an IT platform, enabling the investigation of potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). In this paper, we outline the utilization of Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) and the openly available Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) software stack as part of PVClinical platform. OMOP-CDM offers the capacity to integrate data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) (e.g., encounters, patients, providers, diagnoses, drugs, measurements and procedures) via an accepted data model. Furthermore, the OHDSI software stack provides valuable analytics tools which could be used to address important questions regarding drug safety quickly and efficiently, enabling the investigation of potential ADRs in the clinical environment.

TI  - PatientExploreR: an extensible application for dynamic visualization of patient clinical history from electronic health records in the OMOP common data model
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS

KW  - PATHWAYS
AB  - Motivation: Electronic health records (EHRs) are quickly becoming omnipresent in healthcare, but interoperability issues and technical demands limit their use for biomedical and clinical research. Interactive and flexible software that interfaces directly with EHR data structured around a common data model (CDM) could accelerate more EHR-based research by making the data more accessible to researchers who lack computational expertise and/or domain knowledge.
   Results: We present PatientExploreR, an extensible application built on the R/Shiny framework that interfaces with a relational database of EHR data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership CDM format. PatientExploreR produces patient-level interactive and dynamic reports and facilitates visualization of clinical data without any programming required. It allows researchers to easily construct and export patient cohorts from the EHR for analysis with other software. This application could enable easier exploration of patient-level data for physicians and researchers. PatientExploreR can incorporate EHR data from any institution that employs the CDM for users with approved access. The software code is free and open source under the MIT license, enabling institutions to install and users to expand and modify the application for their own purposes.

AB  - Background Sharing data across institutions is critical to improving care for children who are using long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV). Mechanical ventilation data are complex and poorly standardized. This lack of data standardization is a major barrier to data sharing. Objective We aimed to describe current ventilator data in the electronic health record (EHR) and propose a framework for standardizing these data using a common data model (CDM) across multiple populations and sites. Methods We focused on a cohort of patients with LTMV dependence who were weaned from mechanical ventilation (MV). We extracted and described relevant EHR ventilation data. We identified the minimum necessary components, termed "Clinical Ideas," to describe MV from time of initiation to liberation. We then utilized existing resources and partnered with informatics collaborators to develop a framework for incorporating Clinical Ideas into the PEDSnet CDM based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). Results We identified 78 children with LTMV dependence who weaned from ventilator support. There were 25 unique device names and 28 unique ventilation mode names used in the cohort. We identified multiple Clinical Ideas necessary to describe ventilator support over time: device, interface, ventilation mode, settings, measurements, and duration of ventilation usage per day. We used Concepts from the SNOMED-CT vocabulary and integrated an existing ventilator mode taxonomy to create a framework for CDM and OMOP integration. Conclusion The proposed framework standardizes mechanical ventilation terminology and may facilitate efficient data exchange in a multisite network. Rapid data sharing is necessary to improve research and clinical care for children with LTMV dependence.

AB  - Background: Patient-monitoring software generates a large amount of data that can be reused for clinical audits and scientific research. The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium developed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize electronic health record data and promote large-scale observational and longitudinal research. Objective: This study aimed to transform primary care data into the OMOP CDM format. Methods: We extracted primary care data from electronic health records at a multidisciplinary health center in Wattrelos, France. We performed structural mapping between the design of our local primary care database and the OMOP CDM tables and fields. Local French vocabularies concepts were mapped to OHDSI standard vocabularies. To validate the implementation of primary care data into the OMOP CDM format, we applied a set of queries. A practical application was achieved through the development of a dashboard. Results: Data from 18,395 patients were implemented into the OMOP CDM, corresponding to 592,226 consultations over a period of 20 years. A total of 18 OMOP CDM tables were implemented. A total of 17 local vocabularies were identified as being related to primary care and corresponded to patient characteristics (sex, location, year of birth, and race), units of measurement, biometric measures, laboratory test results, medical histories, and drug prescriptions. During semantic mapping, 10,221 primary care concepts were mapped to standard OHDSI concepts. Five queries were used to validate the OMOP CDM by comparing the results obtained after the completion of the transformations with the results obtained in the source software. Lastly, a prototype dashboard was developed to visualize the activity of the health center, the laboratory test results, and the drug prescription data. Conclusions: Primary care data from a French health care facility have been implemented into the OMOP CDM format. Data concerning demographics, units, measurements, and primary care consultation steps were already available in OHDSI vocabularies. Laboratory test results and drug prescription data were mapped to available vocabularies and structured in the final model. A dashboard application provided health care professionals with feedback on their practice.

AB  - Background and aimsOpioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid dependence lead to significant morbidity and mortality, yet treatment retention, crucial for the effectiveness of medications like buprenorphine-naloxone, remains unpredictable. Our objective was to determine the predictability of 6-month retention in buprenorphine-naloxone treatment using electronic health record (EHR) data from diverse clinical settings and to identify key predictors.DesignThis retrospective observational study developed and validated machine learning-based clinical risk prediction models using EHR data.Setting and casesData were sourced from Stanford University's healthcare system and Holmusk's NeuroBlu database, reflecting a wide range of healthcare settings. The study analyzed 1800 Stanford and 7957 NeuroBlu treatment encounters from 2008 to 2023 and from 2003 to 2023, respectively.MeasurementsPredict continuous prescription of buprenorphine-naloxone for at least 6 months, without a gap of more than 30 days. The performance of machine learning prediction models was assessed by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) analysis as well as precision, recall and calibration. To further validate our approach's clinical applicability, we conducted two secondary analyses: a time-to-event analysis on a single site to estimate the duration of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment continuity evaluated by the C-index and a comparative evaluation against predictions made by three human clinical experts.FindingsAttrition rates at 6 months were 58% (NeuroBlu) and 61% (Stanford). Prediction models trained and internally validated on NeuroBlu data achieved ROC-AUCs up to 75.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.6-78.0). Addiction medicine specialists' predictions show a ROC-AUC of 67.8 (95% CI = 50.4-85.2). Time-to-event analysis on Stanford data indicated a median treatment retention time of 65 days, with random survival forest model achieving an average C-index of 65.9. The top predictor of treatment retention identified included the diagnosis of opioid dependence.ConclusionsUS patients with opioid use disorder or opioid dependence treated with buprenorphine-naloxone prescriptions appear to have a high (similar to 60%) treatment attrition by 6 months. Machine learning models trained on diverse electronic health record datasets appear to be able to predict treatment continuity with accuracy comparable to that of clinical experts.

AB  - A variety of data models have been developed to provide a standardized data interface that supports organizing clinical research data into a standard structure for building the integrated data repositories. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is emerging as a next generation standards framework for facilitating health care and electronic health records-based data exchange. The objective of the study was to design and assess a consensus-based approach for harmonizing the OHDSI CDM with HL7 FHIR. We leverage a FHIR W5 (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) Classification System for designing the harmonization approaches and assess their utility in achieving the consensus among curators using a standard inter-rater agreement measure. Moderate agreement was achieved for the model-level harmonization (kappa=0.50) whereas only fair agreement was achieved for the property-level harmonization (kappa=0.21). FHIR W5 is a useful tool in designing the harmonization approaches between data models and FHIR, and facilitating the consensus achievement.

AB  - Objective Clinical encounter data are heterogeneous and vary greatly from institution to institution. These problems of variance affect interpretability and usability of clinical encounter data for analysis. These problems are magnified when multisite electronic health record (EHR) data are networked together. This article presents a novel, generalizable method for resolving encounter heterogeneity for analysis by combining related atomic encounters into composite "macrovisits." Materials and Methods Encounters were composed of data from 75 partner sites harmonized to a common data model as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, a project of the National Covid Cohort Collaborative. Summary statistics were computed for overall and site-level data to assess issues and identify modifications. Two algorithms were developed to refine atomic encounters into cleaner, analyzable longitudinal clinical visits. Results Atomic inpatient encounters data were found to be widely disparate between sites in terms of length-of-stay (LOS) and numbers of OMOP CDM measurements per encounter. After aggregating encounters to macrovisits, LOS and measurement variance decreased. A subsequent algorithm to identify hospitalized macrovisits further reduced data variability. Discussion Encounters are a complex and heterogeneous component of EHR data and native data issues are not addressed by existing methods. These types of complex and poorly studied issues contribute to the difficulty of deriving value from EHR data, and these types of foundational, large-scale explorations, and developments are necessary to realize the full potential of modern real-world data. Conclusion This article presents method developments to manipulate and resolve EHR encounter data issues in a generalizable way as a foundation for future research and analysis.

AB  - Objective The Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC) and other PCORnet Clinical Data Research Networks capture healthcare utilization within their health systems. Here, we describe a reusable environment (GPC Reusable Observable Unified Study Environment [GROUSE]) that integrates hospital and electronic health records (EHRs) data with state-wide Medicare and Medicaid claims and assess how claims and clinical data complement each other to identify obesity and related comorbidities in a patient sample. Materials and Methods EHR, billing, and tumor registry data from 7 healthcare systems were integrated with Center for Medicare (2011-2016) and Medicaid (2011-2012) services insurance claims to create deidentified databases in Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside and PCORnet Common Data Model formats. We describe technical details of how this federally compliant, cloud-based data environment was built. As a use case, trends in obesity rates for different age groups are reported, along with the relative contribution of claims and EHR data-to-data completeness and detecting common comorbidities. Results GROUSE contained 73 billion observations from 24 million unique patients (12.9 million Medicare; 13.9 million Medicaid; 6.6 million GPC patients) with 1 674 134 patients crosswalked and 983 450 patients with body mass index (BMI) linked to claims. Diagnosis codes from EHR and claims sources underreport obesity by 2.56 times compared with body mass index measures. However, common comorbidities such as diabetes and sleep apnea diagnoses were more often available from claims diagnoses codes (1.6 and 1.4 times, respectively). Conclusion GROUSE provides a unified EHR-claims environment to address health system and federal privacy concerns, which enables investigators to generalize analyses across health systems integrated with multistate insurance claims.

AB  - Background: Falls in acute care settings threaten patients' safety. Researchers have been developing fall risk prediction models and exploring risk factors to provide evidence-based fall prevention practices; however, such efforts are hindered by insufficient samples, limited covariates, and a lack of standardized methodologies that aid study replication.
   Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) convert fall-related electronic health record data into the standardized Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's (OMOP) common data model format and (2) develop models that predict fall risk during 2 time periods.
   Methods: As a pilot feasibility test, we converted fall-related electronic health record data (nursing notes, fall risk assessment sheet, patient acuity assessment sheet, and clinical observation sheet) into standardized OMOP common data model format using an extraction, transformation, and load process. We developed fall risk prediction models for 2 time periods (within 7 days of admission and during the entire hospital stay) using 2 algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and random forest).
   Results: In total, 6277 nursing statements, 747,049,486 clinical observation sheet records, 1,554,775 fall risk scores, and 5,685,011 patient acuity scores were converted into OMOP common data model format. All our models (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.692-0.726) performed better than the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model. Patient acuity score, fall history, age >= 60 years, movement disorder, and central nervous system agents were the most important predictors in the logistic regression models.
   Conclusions: To enhance model performance further, we are currently converting all nursing records into the OMOP common data model data format, which will then be included in the models. Thus, in the near future, the performance of fall risk prediction models could be improved through the application of abundant nursing records and external validation.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to advance the MetaLAB algorithm and verify its performance with multicenter data to effectively detect major adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including drug-induced liver injury.Methods: Based on MetaLAB, we created an optimal scenario for detecting ADRs by considering demographic and clinical records. MetaLAB-HOI was developed to identify ADR signals using common model-based multicenter electronic health record (EHR) data from the clinical health outcomes of interest (HOI) template and design for drug-exposed and nonexposed groups. In this study, we calculated the odds ratio of 101 drugs for HOI in Konyang University Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, Chungbuk National University Hospital, and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.Results: The overlapping drugs in four medical centers are amlodipine, aspirin, bisoprolol, carvedilol, clopidogrel, clozapine, digoxin, diltiazem, methotrexate, and rosuvastatin. We developed MetaLAB-HOI, an algorithm that can detect ADRs more efficiently using EHR. We compared the detection results of four medical centers, with drug-induced liver injuries as representative ADRs.Conclusions: MetaLAB-HOI's strength lies in fully utilizing the patient's clinical information, such as prescription, procedure, and laboratory results, to detect ADR signals. Considering changes in the patient's condition over time, we created an algorithm based on a scenario that accounted for each drug exposure and onset period supervised by specialists for HOI. We determined that when a template capable of detecting ADR based on clinical evidence is developed and manualized, it can be applied in medical centers for new drugs with insufficient data.

AB  - We leveraged the largely untapped resource of electronic health record data to address critical clinical and epidemiological questions about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 hospitals across five countries (). Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the trajectory of COVID-19 disease in patients and their response to interventions.

AB  - Social determinants of health (SDoH) are increasingly important factors for population health, healthcare outcomes, and care delivery. However, many of these factors are not reliably captured within structured electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we evaluated and adapted a previously published NLP tool to include additional social risk factors for deployment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in an Acute Myocardial Infarction cohort. We developed a transformation of the SDoH outputs of the tool into the OMOP common data model (CDM) for re-use across many potential use cases, yielding performance measures across 8 SDoH classes of precision 0.83 recall 0.74 and F-measure of 0.78.

AB  - Objective The goals of this study were to harmonize data from electronic health records (EHRs) into common units, and impute units that were missing. Materials and Methods The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) table of laboratory measurement data-over 3.1 billion patient records and over 19 000 unique measurement concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common-data-model format from 55 data partners. We grouped ontologically similar OMOP concepts together for 52 variables relevant to COVID-19 research, and developed a unit-harmonization pipeline comprised of (1) selecting a canonical unit for each measurement variable, (2) arriving at a formula for conversion, (3) obtaining clinical review of each formula, (4) applying the formula to convert data values in each unit into the target canonical unit, and (5) removing any harmonized value that fell outside of accepted value ranges for the variable. For data with missing units for all the results within a lab test for a data partner, we compared values with pooled values of all data partners, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results Of the concepts without missing values, we harmonized 88.1% of the values, and imputed units for 78.2% of records where units were absent (41% of contributors' records lacked units). Discussion The harmonization and inference methods developed herein can serve as a resource for initiatives aiming to extract insight from heterogeneous EHR collections. Unique properties of centralized data are harnessed to enable unit inference. Conclusion The pipeline we developed for the pooled N3C data enables use of measurements that would otherwise be unavailable for analysis.

AB  - Eligibility criteria are important for clinical research protocols or clinical practice guidelines for determining who qualms for studies and to whom clinical evidence is applicable, but the free-text format is not amenable for computational processing. In this paper, we described a practical method for transforming free-text clinical research eligibility criteria of Alzheimer's clinical trials into a structured relational database compliant with standards for medical terminologies and clinical data models. We utilized a hybrid natural language processing system and a concept normalization tool to extract medical terms in clinical research eligibility criteria and represent them using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) v.5. We created a database schema design to store syntactic relations to facilitate efficient cohort queries. We further discussed the potential of applying this method to trials on other diseases and the promise of using it to accelerate clinical research with electronic health records.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate common data models (CDMs) to determine which is best suited for sharing data from a large, longitudinal, electronic health record (EHR)-based community registry.
   Materials and methods: Four CDMs were chosen from models in use for clinical research data: Sentinel v5.0 (referred to as the Mini-Sentinel CDM in previous versions), PCORnet v3.0 (an extension of the Mini -Sentinel CDM), OMOP v5.0, and CDISC SDTM v1.4. Each model was evaluated against 11 criteria adapted from previous research. The criteria fell into six categories: content coverage, integrity, flexibility, ease of querying, standards compatibility, and ease and extent of implementation.
   Results: The OMOP CDM accommodated the highest percentage of our data elements (76%), fared well on other requirements, and had broader terminology coverage than the other models. Sentinel and PCORnet fell short in content coverage with 37% and 48% matches respectively. Although SDTM accommodated a significant percentage of data elements (55% true matches), 45% of the data elements mapped to SDTM's extension mechanism, known as Supplemental Qualifiers, increasing the number of joins required to query the data.
   Conclusion: The OMOP CDM best met the criteria for supporting data sharing from longitudinal EHR-based studies. Conclusions may differ for other uses and associated data element sets, but the methodology reported here is easily adaptable to common data model evaluation for other uses.

AB  - PurposeThe US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Innovation Center aimed to establish a query-ready, quality-checked distributed data network containing electronic health records (EHRs) linked with insurance claims data for at least 10 million individuals to expand the utility of real-world data for regulatory decision-making. MethodsIn this report, we describe the resulting network, the Real-World Evidence Data Enterprise (RWE-DE), including data from two commercial EHR-claims linked assets collectively termed the Commercial Network covering 21 million lives, and four academic partner institutions collectively termed the Development Network covering 4.5 million lives. ResultsWe discuss provenance and completeness of the data converted in the Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM), describe patient populations, and report on EHR-claims linkage characterization for all contributing data sources. Further, we introduce a standardized process to store free-text notes in the Development Network for efficient retrieval as needed. ConclusionsFinally, we outline typical use cases for the RWE-DE where it can broaden the reach of the types of questions that can be addressed by the Sentinel system.

AB  - Background: Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are essential in health care for collecting and storing patient medical data. They provide critical information to doctors and caregivers, facilitating improved decision-making and patient care. Despite their significance, optimizing EMR systems is crucial for enhancing health care quality. Implementing the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) shared data model represents a promising approach to improve EMR performance and overall health care outcomes. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effects of implementing the OMOP shared data model in EMR systems and to assess its impact on enhancing health care quality. Methods: In this study, 3 distinct methodologies are used to explore various aspects of health care information systems. First, factor analysis is utilized to investigate the correlations between EMR systems and attitudes toward OMOP. Second, the best-worst method (BWM) is applied to determine the weights of criteria and subcriteria. Lastly, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique is used to illustrate the interactions and interdependencies among the identified criteria. Results: In this research, we evaluated the AliHealth EMR system by surveying 98 users and practitioners to assess its effectiveness and user satisfaction. The study reveals that among all components, "EMR resolution" holds the highest importance with a weight of 0.31007783, highlighting its significant role in the evaluation. Conversely, "EMR ease of use" has the lowest weight of 0.1860467, indicating that stakeholders prioritize the resolution aspect over ease of use in their assessment of EMR systems. Conclusions: The findings highlight that stakeholders prioritize certain aspects of EMR systems, with "EMR resolution" being the most valued component.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe application of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to support medical device real-world evaluation in a National Evaluation System for health Technology Coordinating Center (NESTcc) Test-Case involving 2 healthcare systems, Mercy Health and Mayo Clinic. CDM implementation was coordinated across 2 healthcare systems with multiple hospitals to aggregate both medical device data from supply chain databases and patient outcomes and covariates from electronic health record data. Several data quality assurance (QA) analyses were implemented on the OMOP CDM to validate the data extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) process. OMOP CDM-based data of relevant patient encounters were successfully established to support studies for FDA regulatory submissions. QA analyses verified that the data transformation was robust between data sources and OMOP CDM. Our efforts provided useful insights in real-world data integration using OMOP CDM for medical device evaluation coordinated across multiple healthcare systems.
   Lay Summary Data standardization is essential for integrating and linking medical device identification information to diverse data sources across different institutions for research use. A common data model (CDM) could facilitate medical device data standardization and integration. In this study, we described the application of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to support ThermoCool medical device real-world evaluation involving 2 healthcare systems, Mercy Health and Mayo Clinic. Specifically, we collected the device data from the supply chain database by unique device identifiers and related patients' clinical data from the electronic health record (EHR) database. Then, OMOP CDM-based database was designed and implemented to standardize and integrate device data and EHR data together in both Mercy Health and Mayo Clinic. Quality assurance verified that the data transformation was robust between data sources and OMOP CDM. Our efforts provided useful insights into real-world data integration using OMOP CDM for medical device evaluation coordinated across multiple healthcare systems. And our process could be generalized for use by other institutions.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) and other real-world data (RWD) are critical to accelerating and scaling care improvement and transformation. To efficiently leverage it for secondary uses, EHR/RWD should be optimally managed and mapped to industry standard concepts (ISCs). Inherent challenges in concept encoding usually result in inefficient and costly workflows and resultant metadata representation structures outside the EHR. Using three related projects to map data to ISCs, we describe the development of standard, repeatable processes for precisely and unambiguously representing EHR data using appropriate ISCs within the EHR platform lifecycle and mappings specific to SNOMED-CT for Demographics, Specialty and Services. Mappings in these 3 areas resulted in ISC mappings of 779 data elements requiring 90 new concept requests to SNOMED-CT and 738 new ISCs mapped into the workflow within an accessible, enterprise-wide EHR resource with supporting processes.

AB  - Objective More than one third of appropriately treated patients with epilepsy have continued seizures despite two or more medication trials, meeting criteria for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Accurate and reliable identification of patients with DRE in observational data would enable large-scale, real-world comparative effectiveness research and improve access to specialized epilepsy care. In the present study, we aim to develop and compare the performance of computable phenotypes for DRE using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. Methods We randomly sampled 600 patients from our academic medical center's electronic health record (EHR)-derived OMOP database meeting previously validated criteria for epilepsy (January 2015-August 2021). Two reviewers manually classified patients as having DRE, drug-responsive epilepsy, undefined drug responsiveness, or no epilepsy as of the last EHR encounter in the study period based on consensus definitions. Demographic characteristics and codes for diagnoses, antiseizure medications (ASMs), and procedures were tested for association with DRE. Algorithms combining permutations of these factors were applied to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for DRE. The F1 score was used to compare overall performance. Results Among 412 patients with source record-confirmed epilepsy, 62 (15.0%) had DRE, 163 (39.6%) had drug-responsive epilepsy, 124 (30.0%) had undefined drug responsiveness, and 63 (15.3%) had insufficient records. The best performing phenotype for DRE in terms of the F1 score was the presence of >= 1 intractable epilepsy code and >= 2 unique non-gabapentinoid ASM exposures each with >= 90-day drug era (sensitivity = .661, specificity = .937, PPV = .594, NPV = .952, F1 score = .626). Several phenotypes achieved higher sensitivity at the expense of specificity and vice versa. Significance OMOP algorithms can identify DRE in EHR-derived data with varying tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. These computable phenotypes can be applied across the largest international network of standardized clinical databases for further validation, reproducible observational research, and improving access to appropriate care.

AB  - PURPOSE The specific aims of this paper are to (1) develop and operationalize an electronic health record (EHR) data quality framework, (2) apply the dimensions of the framework to the phenotype and treatment pathways of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) using All of Us Research Program data, and (3) propose and apply a checklist to evaluate the application of the framework. METHODS We developed a framework of five data quality dimensions (DQD; completeness, concordance, conformance, plausibility, and temporality). Participants signed a consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization to share EHR data and responded to demographic questions in the Basics questionnaire. We evaluated the internal characteristics of the data and compared data with external benchmarks with descriptive and inferential statistics. We developed a DQD checklist to evaluate concept selection, internal verification, and external validity for each DQD. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) concept ID codes for DCIS were used to select a cohort of 2,209 females 18 years and older. RESULTS Using the proposed DQD checklist criteria, (1) concepts were selected and internally verified for conformance; (2) concepts were selected and internally verified for completeness; (3) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for concordance; (4) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for plausibility; and (5) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for temporality. CONCLUSION This assessment and evaluation provided insights into data quality for the DCIS phenotype using EHR data from the All of Us Research Program. The review demonstrates that salient clinical measures can be selected, applied, and operationalized within a conceptual framework and evaluated for fitness for use by applying a proposed checklist.

AB  - Introduction: Efforts to characterize variability in epilepsy treatment pathways are limited by the large number of possible antiseizure medication (ASM) regimens and sequences, heterogeneity of patients, and challenges of measuring confounding variables and outcomes across institutions. The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative is an international data network representing over 1 billion patient records using common data standards. However, few studies have applied OHDSI's Common Data Model (CDM) to the population with epilepsy and none have validated relevant concepts. The goals of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing adult patients with epilepsy and ASM treatment pathways using the CDM in an electronic health record (EHR)-derived database.Methods: We validated a phenotype algorithm for epilepsy in adults using the CDM in an EHR-derived database (2001-2020) against source records and a prospectively maintained database of patients with confirmed epilepsy. We obtained the frequency of all antecedent conditions and procedures for patients meeting the epilepsy phenotype criteria and characterized ASM exposure sequences over time and by age and sex.Results: The phenotype algorithm identified epilepsy with 73.0-85.0% positive predictive value and 86.3% sensitivity. Many patients had neurologic conditions and diagnoses antecedent to meeting epilepsy criteria. Levetiracetam incrementally replaced phenytoin as the most common first-line agent, but significant heterogeneity remained, particularly in second-line and subsequent agents. Drug sequences included up to 8 unique ingredients and a total of 1,235 unique pathways were observed.Conclusions: Despite the availability of additional ASMs in the last 2 decades and accumulated guidelines and evidence, ASM use varies significantly in practice, particularly for second-line and subsequent agents. Multi-center OHDSI studies have the potential to better characterize the full extent of variability and support observational comparative effectiveness research, but additional work is needed to validate covariates and outcomes.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Rehabilitation research focuses on determining the components of a treatment intervention, the mechanism of how these components lead to recovery and rehabilitation, and ultimately the optimal intervention strategies to maximize patients' physical, psychologic, and social functioning. Traditional randomized clinical trials that study and establish new interventions face challenges, such as high cost and time commitment. Observational studies that use existing clinical data to observe the effect of an intervention have shown several advantages over RCTs. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an increasingly important resource for conducting observational studies. To support these studies, we developed a clinical research datamart, called ReDWINE (Rehabilitation Datamart With Informatics iNfrastructure for rEsearch), that transforms the rehabilitation-related EHR data collected from the UPMC health care system to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to facilitate rehabilitation research. The standardized EHR data stored in ReDWINE will further reduce the time and effort required by investigators to pool, harmonize, clean, and analyze data from multiple sources, leading to more robust and comprehensive research findings. ReDWINE also includes deployment of data visualization and data analytics tools to facilitate cohort definition and clinical data analysis. These include among others the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) toolkit, a high-throughput NLP pipeline, to provide text analytical capabilities at scale in ReDWINE. Using this comprehensive representation of patient data in ReDWINE for rehabilitation research will facilitate real-world evidence for health interventions and outcomes.

AB  - Observational Medical Outcome Partners - Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) is an international standard model for standardizing electronic medical record data. However, unstructured data such as medical image data which is beyond the scope of standardization by the current OMOP-CDM is difficult to be used in multi-institutional collaborative research. Therefore, we developed the Radiology-CDM (R-CDM) which standardizes medical imaging data. As a proof of concept, 737,500 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data from two tertiary hospitals in South Korea is standardized in the form of R-CDM. The relationship between chronic disease and retinal thickness was analyzed by using the R-CDM. Central macular thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were significantly thinner in the patients with hypertension compared to the control cohort. It is meaningful in that multi-institutional collaborative research using medical image data and clinical data simultaneously can be conducted very efficiently.

TI  - REDCap on FHIR: Clinical Data Interoperability Services
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA  - English
KW  - Electronic health record
KW  - Electronic data capture
KW  - Clinical research
KW  - Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
AB  - Background: Despite widespread use of electronic data capture (EDC) systems for research and electronic health records (EHR), most transfer of data between EHR and EDC systems is manual and error prone. Increased adoption of Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs) in recent years by EHR systems has increased the availability of patient data for external applications such as REDCap. Objective: Describe the development of the REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) module that provides seamless data exchange between the REDCap research EDC and any EHR system with a FHIR API. CDIS enables end users to independently set up their data collection projects, map EHR data to fields, and adjudicate data transfer without project-by-project involvement from Health Information Technology staff. Methods: We identified two use cases for EHR data transfer into REDCap. Clinical Data Pull (CDP) automatically pulls EHR data into user-defined REDCap fields and replaces the workflow of having to transcribe or copy and paste data from the EHR. Clinical Data Mart (CDM) collects all specified data for a patient over a given time period and replaces the process of importing EHR data for registries from research databases. With an iterative process, we designed our access control, authentication, variable selection, and mapping interfaces in such a way that end users could easily set up and use CDIS. Results: Since its release, the REDCap CDIS has been used to pull over 19.5 million data points for 82 projects at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Software and documentation are available through the REDCap Consortium. Conclusions: The new REDCap Clinical Data and Interoperability Services (CDIS) module leverages the FHIR standard to enable real-time and direct data extraction from the EHR. Researchers can self-service the mapping and adjudication of EHR data into REDCap. The uptake of CDIS at VUMC and other REDCap consortium sites is improving the accuracy and efficiency of EHR data collection by reducing the need for manual transcription and flat file uploads.

AB  - Objectives Despite easy-to-use tools like the Cohort Builder, using All of Us Research Program data for complex research questions requires a relatively high level of technical expertise. We aimed to increase research and training capacity and reduce barriers to entry for the All of Us community through an R package, allofus. In this article, we describe functions that address common challenges we encountered while working with All of Us Research Program data, and we demonstrate this functionality with an example of creating a cohort of All of Us participants by synthesizing electronic health record and survey data with time dependencies.Target audience All of Us Research Program data are widely available to health researchers. The allofus R package is aimed at a wide range of researchers who wish to conduct complex analyses using best practices for reproducibility and transparency, and who have a range of experience using R. Because the All of Us data are transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), researchers familiar with existing OMOP CDM tools or who wish to conduct network studies in conjunction with other OMOP CDM data will also find value in the package.Scope We developed an initial set of functions that solve problems we experienced across survey and electronic health record data in our own research and in mentoring student projects. The package will continue to grow and develop with the All of Us Research Program. The allofus R package can help build community research capacity by increasing access to the All of Us Research Program data, the efficiency of its use, and the rigor and reproducibility of the resulting research.

AB  - Observational data resources based on the capture of clinical data in the electronic health record (EHR) have produced significant learning opportunities in many areas of medicine. These large data resources can span multiple hospital systems and employ common semantics, ontologies, and data models. They have uncovered critical safety issues for patients, and spurred observational research and clinical decision support. In the age of precision medicine there is also an increased need to obtain genomic and clinical data to discover novel treatments for the deadliest of diseases. With this, there are efforts to create deep-dive disease specific repositories that include tissue in biobanks. The latter require significant human annotation of biospecimens. Securing the data is especially critical in rare pediatric brain tumors. In the specific case of The Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium (CBTTC) an international rare pediatric brain tumor repository, the number of patients that need to be followed prospectively is outpacing the ability of human annotation. In this preliminary study, we perform a prescribed data exploration analysis on simulation data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) employed by the pediatric data network PEDSNet with the intention to ascertain feasibility in automatic annotation of patient records in the CBTTC.

AB  - Objective To study the association between COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of post-COVID-19 cardiac and thromboembolic complications.Methods We conducted a staggered cohort study based on national vaccination campaigns using electronic health records from the UK, Spain and Estonia. Vaccine rollout was grouped into four stages with predefined enrolment periods. Each stage included all individuals eligible for vaccination, with no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccine at the start date. Vaccination status was used as a time-varying exposure. Outcomes included heart failure (HF), venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thrombosis/thromboembolism (ATE) recorded in four time windows after SARS-CoV-2 infection: 0-30, 31-90, 91-180 and 181-365 days. Propensity score overlap weighting and empirical calibration were used to minimise observed and unobserved confounding, respectively. Fine-Gray models estimated subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR). Random effect meta-analyses were conducted across staggered cohorts and databases.Methods We conducted a staggered cohort study based on national vaccination campaigns using electronic health records from the UK, Spain and Estonia.

Propensity score overlap weighting and empirical calibration were used to minimise observed and unobserved confounding, respectively. Fine-Gray models estimated subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR). Random effect meta-analyses were conducted across staggered cohorts and databases.Results The study included 10.17 million vaccinated and 10.39 million unvaccinated people. Vaccination was associated with reduced risks of acute (30-day) and post-acute COVID-19 VTE, ATE and HF: for example, meta-analytic sHR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.29), 0.53 (0.44 to 0.63) and 0.45 (0.38 to 0.53), respectively, for 0-30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while in the 91-180 days sHR were 0.53 (0.40 to 0.70), 0.72 (0.58 to 0.88) and 0.61 (0.51 to 0.73), respectively.Conclusions COVID-19 vaccination reduced the risk of post-COVID-19 cardiac and thromboembolic outcomes. These effects were more pronounced for acute COVID-19 outcomes, consistent with known reductions in disease severity following breakthrough versus unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and public health problem, the management of which will benefit from large-scale pragmatic research that leverages electronic medical records (EMR). Requisite to using EMRs for HF research is the development of reliable algorithms to identify HF patients. We aimed to develop and validate computable phenotype algorithms to identify patients with HF using standardized data elements defined by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) Common Data Model (CDM).
   Methods: We built HF computable phenotypes utilizing the data domains of HF diagnosis codes, prescribed HF-related medications and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Algorithms were validated in a cohort (n = 76,254) drawn from Olmsted County, MN between 2010-2012 a sample of whose records were manually reviewed to confirm HF according to Framingham criteria.
   Results: The different algorithms we tested provided different tradeoffs between sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). The highest sensitivity (78.7%) algorithm utilized one HF diagnosis code and had the lowest PPV (68.5%). The addition of more algorithm components, such as additional HF diagnosis codes, HF medications or elevated NT-proBNP, improved the PPV while reducing sensitivity. When added to a diagnostic code, the addition of NT-proBNP ( > 450 pg/mL) had a similar impact compared to additional HF medication criteria, increasing PPV by similar to 3-4% and decreasing sensitivity by similar to 7-10%.
   Conclusions: Algorithms derived from PCORnet CDM elements can be used to identify patients with HF without manual adjudication with reasonable sensitivity and PPV. Algorithm choice should be driven by the goal of the research.

AB  - Clinical documentation in electronic health records contains crucial narratives and details about patients and their care. Natural language processing (NLP) can unlock the information conveyed in clinical notes and reports, and thus plays a critical role in real-world studies. The NLP Working Group at the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium was established to develop methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and NLP in real-world observational studies. In this paper, we describe a framework for repre-senting and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), the workflow and tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical notes into tables in OMOP CDM, as well as current applications and specific use cases of the proposed OHDSI NLP solution at large consortia and individual institutions with English textual data. Challenges faced and lessons learned during the process are also discussed to provide valuable insights for researchers who are planning to implement NLP so-lutions in real-world studies.

AB  - Objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the value of real-world data for public health research. International federated analyses are crucial for informing policy makers. Common data models (CDMs) are critical for enabling these studies to be performed efficiently. Our objective was to convert the UK Biobank, a study of 500 000 participants with rich genetic and phenotypic data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM. Materials and Methods We converted UK Biobank data to OMOP CDM v. 5.3. We transformedparticipant research data on diseases collected at recruitment and electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care, hospitalizations, cancer registrations, and mortality from providers in England, Scotland, and Wales. We performed syntactic and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk factors between source and transformed data. Results We identified 502 505 participants (3086 with COVID-19) and transformed 690 fields (1 373 239 555 rows) to the OMOP CDM using 8 different controlled clinical terminologies and bespoke mappings. Specifically, we transformed self-reported noncancer illnesses 946 053 (83.91% of all source entries), cancers 37 802 (70.81%), medications 1 218 935 (88.25%), and prescriptions 864 788 (86.96%). In EHR, we transformed 13 028 182 (99.95%) hospital diagnoses, 6 465 399 (89.2%) procedures, 337 896 333 primary care diagnoses (CTV3, SNOMED-CT), 139 966 587 (98.74%) prescriptions (dm+d) and 77 127 (99.95%) deaths (ICD-10). We observed good concordance across demographic, risk factor, and comorbidity factors between source and transformed data. Discussion and Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can be successfully leveraged to harmonize complex large-scale biobanked studies combining rich multimodal phenotypic data. Our study uncovered several challenges when transforming data from questionnaires to the OMOP CDM which require further research. The transformed UK Biobank resource is a valuable tool that can enable federated research, like COVID-19 studies.

AB  - Background: Use of existing data in electronic health records (EHRs) could be used more extensively to better leverage real world data for clinical studies, but only if standard, reliable processes are developed. Numerous computable phenotypes have been validated against manual chart review, and common data models (CDMs) exist to aid implementation of such phenotypes across platforms and sites. Our objective was to measure consistency between data that had previously been manually collected for an implantable cardiac device registry and CDM-based phenotypes for the condition of heart failure (HF).Methods: Patients enrolled in an implantable cardiac device registry at two hospitals from 2013 to 2018 contributed to this analysis wherein registry data were compared to PCORnet CDM-formatted EHR data. Seven different phenotype algorithms were used to search for the presence of HF and compare the results with the registry. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and congruence were calculated for each phenotype.Results: In the registry, 176 of 319 (55%) patients had history of HF, compared with different phenotypes estimating between 96 (30%) and 188 (59%). The least-restrictive phenotypes (any diagnosis) had high sensitivity and specificity (90%/80%), but more restrictive phenotypes had higher specificity (e.g., code present in problem list, 94%). Differences were observed using time-based criteria (e.g., days between visit diagnoses) and between participating hospitals.Conclusions: Consistency between manually-collected registry data and CDM-based phenotypes for history of HF was high overall, but use of different phenotypes impacted sensitivity and specificity, and results may differ depending on the medical condition of interest.

AB  - Background Integration of electronic health records (EHRs) data across sites and access to that data remain limited.
   Objective We developed an EHR-based pediatric inpatient repository using nine U.S. centers from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Pediatric Trials Network.
   Methods A data model encompassing 147 mandatory and 99 optional elements was developed to provide an EHR data extract of all inpatient encounters from patients <17 years of age discharged between January 6, 2013 and June 30, 2017. Sites received instructions on extractions, transformation, testing, and transmission to the coordinating center.
   Results We generated 177 staging reports to process all nine sites' 147 mandatory and 99 optional data elements to the repository. Based on 520 prespecified criteria, all sites achieved 0% errors and <2% warnings. The repository includes 386,159 inpatient encounters from 264,709 children to support study design and conduct of future trials in children.
   Conclusion Our EHR-based data repository of pediatric inpatient encounters utilized a customized data model heavily influenced by the PCORnet format, site-based data mapping, a comprehensive set of data testing rules, and an iterative process of data submission. The common data model, site-based extraction, and technical expertise were key to our success. Data from this repository will be used in support of Pediatric Trials Network studies and the labeling of drugs and devices for children.

Methods TMUCRD was developed by integrating EHRs from three affiliated hospitals, including Taipei Medical University Hospital, Wan-Fang Hospital and Shuang-Ho Hospital. The data cover over 15 years and include diverse patient care information. The database was converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) for standardisation. Results TMUCRD comprises 89 tables (eg, 29 tables for each hospital and 2 linked tables), including demographics, diagnoses, medications, procedures and measurements, among others. It encompasses data from more than 4.15 million patients with various medical records, spanning from the year 2004 to 2021. The dataset offers insights into disease prevalence, medication usage, laboratory tests and patient characteristics. DiscussionTMUCRD stands out due to its unique advantages, including diverse data types, comprehensive patient information, linked mortality and cancer registry data, regular updates and a swift application process. Its compatibility with the OMOP CDM enhances its usability and interoperability. Conclusion TMUCRD serves as a valuable resource for researchers and scholars interested in leveraging RWD for clinical research. Its availability and integration of diverse healthcare data contribute to a collaborative and data-driven approach to advancing medical knowledge and practice.

AB  - PCORnet, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network, is comprised of health systems and health plans that transform electronic health records (EHRs) and claims data to a common data model (CDM) to facilitate real-world clinical research. Because patients receive health care in multiple care delivery settings, linking health records across systems and health plan claims would provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of health care for patients. The current study expanded on a PCORnet Antibiotics and Childhood Growth (ABX) study to (1) identify and implement a privacy-preserving patient linkage solution among a clinical data research network and a health plan network within the ABX Study, and (2) assess overlap in prescribed and dispensed antibiotics and additional data gained from claims among the linked patients. This manuscript describes the linkage process and resulting overlap analysis. The authors identified 549 patients from the EHR record study cohort who had claims records with the health plan. Sixty percent (n = 329) of patients had consistent antibiotic exposure data across the 2 sources, indicating antibiotic exposure (44.3%) or nonexposure (15.7%). Among total antibiotic prescribing records, 43.1% had a matched claims record for dispensing within 60 days. Among antibiotic dispense records 26.5% were not associated with a prescribing record in the linked health systems. These findings showcase the feasibility of linking health plan claims data to PCORnet CDM in a privacy-preserving manner while also demonstrating continued gaps in data that may occur. The study highlights the importance of combining multiple health data sources for comprehensive clinical research.

AB  - Background Common data models (CDMs) enable data to be standardized, and facilitate data exchange, sharing, and storage, particularly when the data have been collected via distinct, heterogeneous systems. Moreover, CDMs provide tools for data quality assessment, integration into models, visualization, and analysis. The observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) provides a CDM for organizing and standardizing databases. Common data models not only facilitate data integration but also (and especially for the OMOP model) extends the range of available statistical analyses. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing French national electronic health records in the OMOP CDM. Methods The OMOP's specifications were used to audit the source data, specify the transformation into the OMOP CDM, implement an extract-transform-load process to feed data from the French health care system into the OMOP CDM, and evaluate the final database. Results Seventeen vocabularies corresponding to the French context were added to the OMOP CDM's concepts. Three French terminologies were automatically mapped to standardized vocabularies. We loaded nine tables from the OMOP CDM's "standardized clinical data" section, and three tables from the "standardized health system data" section. Outpatient and inpatient data from 38,730 individuals were integrated. The median (interquartile range) number of outpatient and inpatient stays per patient was 160 (19-364). Conclusion Our results demonstrated that data from the French national health care system can be integrated into the OMOP CDM. One of the main challenges was the use of international OMOP concepts to annotate data recorded in a French context. The use of local terminologies was an obstacle to conceptual mapping; with the exception of an adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision, the French health care system does not use international terminologies. It would be interesting to extend our present findings to the 65 million people registered in the French health care system.

AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel System uses a distributed data network, a common data model, curated real-world data, and distributed analytic tools to generate evidence for FDA decision-making. Sentinel system needs include analytic flexibility, transparency, and reproducibility while protecting patient privacy. Based on over a decade of experience, a critical system limitation is the inability to identify enough medical conditions of interest in observational data to a satisfactory level of accuracy. Improving the system's ability to use computable phenotypes will require an "all of the above" approach that improves use of electronic health data while incorporating the growing array of complementary electronic health record data sources. FDA recently funded a Sentinel System Innovation Center and a Community Building and Outreach Center that will provide a platform for collaboration across disciplines to promote better use of real-world data for decision-making.

AB  - Purpose: Evaluate the degree of concept coverage of the general eye examination in one widely used electronic health record (EHR) system using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM).Design: Study of data elements.Participants: Not applicable.Methods: Data elements (field names and predefined entry values) from the general eye examination in the Epic foundation system were mapped to OMOP concepts and analyzed. Each mapping was given a Health Level 7 equivalence designation-equal when the OMOP concept had the same meaning as the source EHR concept, wider when it was missing information, narrower when it was overly specific, and unmatched when there was no match. Initial mappings were reviewed by 2 graders. Intergrader agreement for equivalence designation was calculated using Cohen's kappa. Agreement on the mapped OMOP concept was calculated as a percentage of total mappable concepts. Discrepancies were discussed and a final consensus created. Quantitative analysis was performed on wider and unmatched concepts.Main outcome measures: Gaps in OMOP concept coverage of EHR elements and intergrader agreement of mapped OMOP concepts.Results: A total of 698 data elements (210 fields, 488 values) from the EHR were analyzed. The intergrader kappa on the equivalence designation was 0.88 (standard error 0.03, P < 0.001). There was a 96% agreement on the mapped OMOP concept. In the final consensus mapping, 25% (1% fields, 31% values) of the EHR to OMOP concept mappings were considered equal, 50% (27% fields, 60% values) wider, 4% (8% fields, 2% values) narrower, and 21% (52% fields, 8% values) unmatched. Of the wider mapped elements, 46% were missing the laterality specification, 24% had other missing attributes, and 30% had both issues. Wider and unmatched EHR elements could be found in all areas of the general eye examination.Conclusions: Most data elements in the general eye examination could not be represented precisely using the OMOP CDM. Our work suggests multiple ways to improve the incorporation of important ophthalmology concepts in OMOP, including adding laterality to existing concepts. There exists a strong need to improve the coverage of ophthalmic concepts in source vocabularies so that the OMOP CDM can better accommodate vision research.

AB  - Objective
   Identifying the time of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection relative to specific gestational weeks is critical for delineating the role of viral infection timing in adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, this task is difficult when it comes to Electronic Health Records (EHR). In combating the COVID-19 pandemic for maternal health, we sought to develop and validate a clinical information extraction algorithm to detect the time of clinical events relative to gestational weeks.
   Materials and methods
   We used EHR from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), in which the EHR are normalized by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). We performed EHR phenotyping, resulting in 270,897 pregnant women (June 1st, 2018 to May 31st, 2021). We developed a rule-based algorithm and performed a multi-level evaluation to test content validity and clinical validity, and extreme length of gestation (<150 or >300).
   Results
   The algorithm identified 296,194 pregnancies (16,659 COVID-19, 174,744 without COVID-19) in 270,897 pregnant women. For inferring gestational age, 95% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high accuracy (Cohen's Kappa = 0.62); 100% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high granularity of temporal information (Cohen's Kappa = 1). For inferring delivery dates, the accuracy is 100% (Cohen's Kappa = 1). The accuracy of gestational age detection for the extreme length of gestation is 93.3% (Cohen's Kappa = 1). Mothers with COVID-19 showed higher prevalence in obesity or overweight (35.1% vs. 29.5%), diabetes (17.8% vs. 17.0%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.2% vs. 0.1%), respiratory distress syndrome or acute respiratory failure (1.8% vs. 0.2%).
   Discussion
   We explored the characteristics of pregnant women by different gestational weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection with our algorithm. TED-PC is the first to infer the exact gestational week linked with every clinical event from EHR and detect the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women.
   Conclusion
   The algorithm shows excellent clinical validity in inferring gestational age and delivery dates, which supports multiple EHR cohorts on N3C studying the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy.

AB  - The DICOM standard has been widely adopted for the exchange and management of biomedical images. Its hierarchical structure allows representing data and metadata of medical imaging studies. However, other patient data not directly related with the study, such as prescriptions and treatments, are stored in independent Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. With the increasing production of medical imaging studies, repositories responsible for storing DICOM images started to contain massive amounts of data. Therefore, retrieving a subset of images based on similar criteria as the ones used in EHR systems, is a complex task for a medical researcher. In this paper, we propose an architecture to define cohorts over medical imaging data sets. This proposal uses a DICOM archive to index and to retrieve images, while the studies' selection is performed through a web application, ATLAS, which is normally used on observational studies upon EHR data. The presented architecture was validated using a public data set with synthetic EHR data.

AB  - Background: Common data models (CDMs) help standardize electronic health record data and facilitate outcome analysis for observational and longitudinal research. An analysis of pathology reports is required to establish fundamental information infrastructure for data-driven colon cancer research. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is used in distributed research networks for clinical data; however, it requires conversion of free text-based pathology reports into the CDM's format. There are few use cases of representing cancer data in CDM.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to construct a CDM database of colon cancer-related pathology with natural language processing (NLP) for a research platform that can utilize both clinical and omics data. The essential text entities from the pathology reports are extracted, standardized, and converted to the OMOP CDM format in order to utilize the pathology data in cancer research.
   Methods: We extracted clinical text entities, mapped them to the standard concepts in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics vocabularies, and built databases and defined relations for the CDM tables. Major clinical entities were extracted through NLP on pathology reports of surgical specimens, immunohistochemical studies, and molecular studies of colon cancer patients at a tertiary general hospital in South Korea. Items were extracted from each report using regular expressions in Python. Unstructured data, such as text that does not have a pattern, were handled with expert advice by adding regular expression rules. Our own dictionary was used for normalization and standardization to deal with biomarker and gene names and other ungrammatical expressions. The extracted clinical and genetic information was mapped to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes databases and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) standard terminologies recommended by the OMOP CDM. The database-table relationships were newly defined through SNOMED standard terminology concepts. The standardized data were inserted into the CDM tables. For evaluation, 100 reports were randomly selected and independently annotated by a medical informatics expert and a nurse.
   Results: We examined and standardized 1848 immunohistochemical study reports, 3890 molecular study reports, and 12,352 pathology reports of surgical specimens (from 2017 to 2018). The constructed and updated database contained the following extracted colorectal entities: (1) NOTE_NLP, (2) MEASUREMENT, (3) CONDITION_ OCCURRENCE, (4) SPECIMEN, and (5) FACT_RELATIONSHIP of specimen with condition and measurement.
   Conclusions: This study aimed to prepare CDM data for a research platform to take advantage of all omics clinical and patient data at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for colon cancer pathology. A more sophisticated preparation of the pathology data is needed for further research on cancer genomics, and various types of text narratives are the next target for additional research on the use of data in the CDM.

AB  - The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has enabled data-driven approaches to clinical care and research. However, the performance and generaliz-ability of those approaches are severely hampered by the lack of syntactic and semantic interoperability of EHR data across institutions. Towards resolving this problem, Common Data Models (CDMs) can be used to standardize the clinical data in clinical data repositories. In this paper, we described our mapping of entity mention types from patient-level information retrieval queries to an empirical subset of Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM data fields. We investigated the empirical data model by annotating multi-institutional clinical data requests in free text and comparing the distributions of data model fields. The similar distribution of the entity mention types from two different sites indicates that the data model is generalizable for multi-institutional cohort identification queries.

AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) represent a crucial data source for real-world evidence generation. To facilitate biomedical studies using EHRs, standard data models like the OMOP CDM have been developed. Nevertheless, recent advancements in biomedical AI research that leverage EHRs have introduced new challenges, encompassing security considerations, large-scale data retrieval, and computational resource management, including GPUs. This paper introduces Kamino, an innovative architectural solution tailored to support biomedical AI research using EHR data. Kamino offers a user-friendly interface with features designed for efficient team access management in accordance with regulatory requirements. It facilitates direct data retrieval from an OMOP CDM instance and includes a resource allocation system based on Kubernetes orchestration. Here, we demonstrate the practical application and utility of Kamino through a clinical natural language processing task. We firmly believe that such a tool will significantly expedite AI research conducted with EHR data within academic institutions.

TI  - Converting clinical document architecture documents to the common data model for incorporating health information exchange data in observational health studies: CDA to CDM
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA  - English
KW  - Clinical document architecture
KW  - Common data model
KW  - Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
KW  - Referral documents
AB  - Background: Utilization of standard health information exchange (HIE) data is growing due to the high adoption rate and interoperability of electronic health record (EHR) systems. However, integration of HIE data into an EHR system is not yet fully adopted in clinical research. In addition, data quality should be verified for the secondary use of these data. Thus, the aims of this study were to convert referral documents in a Health Level 7 (HL7) clinical document architecture (CDA) to the common data model (CDM) to facilitate HIE data availability for longitudinal data analysis, and to identify data quality levels for application in future clinical studies.
   Methods: A total of 21,492 referral CDA documents accumulated for over 10 years in a tertiary general hospital in South Korea were analyzed. To convert CDA documents to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, processes such as CDA parsing, data cleaning, standard vocabulary mapping, CDA-to-CDM mapping, and CDM conversion were performed. The quality of CDM data was then evaluated using the Achilles Heel and visualized with the Achilles tool.
   Results: Mapping five CDA elements (document header, problem, medication, laboratory, and procedure) into an OMOP CDM table resulted in population of 9 CDM tables (person, visit occurrence, condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, measurement, observation, procedure_occurrence, care_site, and provider). Three CDM tables (drug_era, condition_era, and observation_period) were derived from the converted table. From vocabulary mapping codes in CDA documents according to domain, 98.6% of conditions, 68.8% of drugs, 35.7% of measurements, 100% of observation, and 56.4% of procedures were mapped as standard concepts. The conversion rates of the CDA to the OMOP CDM were 96.3% for conditions, 97.2% for drug exposure, 98.1% for procedure occurrence, 55.1% for measurements, and 100% for observation.
   Conclusions: We examined the possibility of CDM conversion by defining mapping rules for CDA-to-CDM conversion using the referral CDA documents collected from clinics in actual medical practice. Although mapping standard vocabulary for CDM conversion requires further improvement, the conversion could facilitate further research on the usage patterns of medical resources and referral patterns.

AB  - PURPOSEThe specific aims of this paper are to (1) develop and operationalize an electronic health record (EHR) data quality framework, (2) apply the dimensions of the framework to the phenotype and treatment pathways of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) using All of Us Research Program data, and (3) propose and apply a checklist to evaluate the application of the framework. METHODSWe developed a framework of five data quality dimensions (DQD; completeness, concordance, conformance, plausibility, and temporality). Participants signed a consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization to share EHR data and responded to demographic questions in the Basics questionnaire. We evaluated the internal characteristics of the data and compared data with external benchmarks with descriptive and inferential statistics. We developed a DQD checklist to evaluate concept selection, internal verification, and external validity for each DQD. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) concept ID codes for DCIS were used to select a cohort of 2,209 females 18 years and older. RESULTSUsing the proposed DQD checklist criteria, (1) concepts were selected and internally verified for conformance; (2) concepts were selected and internally verified for completeness; (3) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for concordance; (4) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for plausibility; and (5) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for temporality. CONCLUSIONThis assessment and evaluation provided insights into data quality for the DCIS phenotype using EHR data from the All of Us Research Program. The review demonstrates that salient clinical measures can be selected, applied, and operationalized within a conceptual framework and evaluated for fitness for use by applying a proposed checklist.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the processes developed by The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) to enable utilization of electronic health record (EHR) data by creating sequentially transformed schemas for use across multiple user types.Methods: We used Microsoft Azure as the cloud service provider and named this effort the Sick-Kids Enterprise-wide Data in Azure Repository (SEDAR). Epic Clarity data from on-premises was copied to a virtual network in Microsoft Azure. Three sequential schemas were developed. The Filtered Schema added a filter to retain only SickKids and valid patients. The Curated Schema created a data structure that was easier to navigate and query. Each table contained a logical unit such as patients, hospital encounters or laboratory tests. Data validation of randomly sampled observations in the Curated Schema was performed. The SK-OMOP Schema was designed to facilitate research and machine learning. Two individuals mapped medical elements to standard Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) concepts.Results: A copy of Clarity data was transferred to Microsoft Azure and updated each night using log shipping. The Filtered Schema and Curated Schema were implemented as stored procedures and executed each night with incremental updates or full loads. Data validation required up to 16 iterations for each Curated Schema table. OMOP concept mapping achieved at least 80 % coverage for each SK-OMOP table.Conclusions: We described our experience in creating three sequential schemas to address different EHR data access requirements. Future work should consider replicating this approach at other institutions to determine whether approaches are generalizable.

AB  - Well-defined large-volume polysomnographic (PSG) data can identify subgroups and predict outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, current PSG data are scattered across numerous sleep laboratories and have different formats in the electronic health record (EHR). Hence, this study aimed to convert EHR PSG into a standardized data format-the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). We extracted the PSG data of a university hospital for the period from 2004 to 2019. We designed and implemented an extract-transform-load (ETL) process to transform PSG data into the OMOP CDM format and verified the data quality through expert evaluation. We converted the data of 11,797 sleep studies into CDM and added 632,841 measurements and 9,535 observations to the existing CDM database. Among 86 PSG parameters, 20 were mapped to CDM standard vocabulary and 66 could not be mapped; thus, new custom standard concepts were created. We validated the conversion and usefulness of PSG data through patient-level prediction analyses for the CDM data. We believe that this study represents the first CDM conversion of PSG. In the future, CDM transformation will enable network research in sleep medicine and will contribute to presenting more relevant clinical evidence.

AB  - BackgroundMost healthcare data sources store information within their own unique schemas, making reliable and reproducible research challenging. Consequently, researchers have adopted various data models to improve the efficiency of research. Transforming and loading data into these models is a labor-intensive process that can alter the semantics of the original data. Therefore, we created a data model with a hierarchical structure that simplifies the transformation process and minimizes data alteration.MethodsThere were two design goals in constructing the tables and table relationships for the Generalized Data Model (GDM). The first was to focus on clinical codes in their original vocabularies to retain the original semantic representation of the data. The second was to retain hierarchical information present in the original data while retaining provenance. The model was tested by transforming synthetic Medicare data; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims; and electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We also tested a subsequent transformation from the GDM into the Sentinel data model.ResultsThe resulting data model contains 19 tables, with the Clinical Codes, Contexts, and Collections tables serving as the core of the model, and containing most of the clinical, provenance, and hierarchical information. In addition, a Mapping table allows users to apply an arbitrarily complex set of relationships among vocabulary elements to facilitate automated analyses.ConclusionsThe GDM offers researchers a simpler process for transforming data, clear data provenance, and a path for users to transform their data into other data models. The GDM is designed to retain hierarchical relationships among data elements as well as the original semantic representation of the data, ensuring consistency in protocol implementation as part of a complete data pipeline for researchers.

AB  - Background-PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors effectively lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and have been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients. We used real-world electronic health record data to characterize use of PCSK9 inhibitors, in addition to standard therapies, according to cardiovascular risk status.
   Methods and Results-Data were obtained from 18 health systems with data marts within the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) using a common data model. Participating sites identified >17.5 million adults, of whom 3.6 million met study criteria. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: (1) dyslipidemia, (2) untreated LDL >= 130 mg/dL, and (3) coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease. Demographics, comorbidities, estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, and lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies were summarized for each group. Participants' average age was 62 years, 50% were female, and 11% were black. LDL cholesterol ranged from 85 to 151 mg/dL. Among patients in groups 1 and 3, 54% received standard lipid-lowering therapies and a PCSK9 inhibitor was prescribed in <1%. PCSK9 inhibitor prescribing was greatest for patients with coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease and, although prescribing increased during the study period, overall PCSK9 inhibitor prescribing was low.
   Conclusions-We successfully used electronic health record data from 18 PCORnet data marts to identify >3.6 million patients meeting criteria for 3 patient groups. Approximately half of patients had been prescribed lipid-lowering medication, but <1% were prescribed PCSK9 inhibitors. PCSK9 inhibitor prescribing increased over time for patients with coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease but not for those with dyslipidemia.

AB  - Background: Although electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely used in secondary assessments, clinical documents are relatively less utilized owing to the lack of standardized clinical text frameworks across different institutions.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop a framework for processing unstructured clinical documents of EHRs and integration with standardized structured data.
   Methods: We developed a framework known as Staged Optimization of Curation, Regularization, and Annotation of clinical text (SOCRATex). SOCRATex has the following four aspects: (1) extracting clinical notes for the target population and preprocessing the data, (2) defining the annotation schema with a hierarchical structure, (3) performing document-level hierarchical annotation using the annotation schema, and (4) indexing annotations for a search engine system. To test the usability of the proposed framework, proof-of-concept studies were performed on EHRs. We defined three distinctive patient groups and extracted their clinical documents (ie, pathology reports, radiology reports, and admission notes). The documents were annotated and integrated into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-common data model (CDM) database. The annotations were used for creating Cox proportional hazard models with different settings of clinical analyses to measure (1) all-cause mortality, (2) thyroid cancer recurrence, and (3) 30-day hospital readmission.
   Results: Overall, 1055 clinical documents of 953 patients were extracted and annotated using the defined annotation schemas. The generated annotations were indexed into an unstructured textual data repository. Using the annotations of pathology reports, we identified that node metastasis and lymphovascular tumor invasion were associated with all-cause mortality among colon and rectum cancer patients (both P=.02). The other analyses involving measuring thyroid cancer recurrence using radiology reports and 30-day hospital readmission using admission notes in depressive disorder patients also showed results consistent with previous findings.
   Conclusions: We propose a framework for hierarchical annotation of textual data and integration into a standardized OMOP-CDM medical database. The proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that our framework can effectively process and integrate diverse clinical documents with standardized structured data for clinical research.

AB  - An adverse drug reaction (ADR) surveillance system integrated with various electronic medical record (EMR) systems has been suggested as an effective way to collect more data and analyze ADRs earlier than the spontaneous reporting of ADRs. Because Korean hospitals have heterogeneous EMR databases, a common data model (CDM) should first be defined to develop the multi-center EMR-based drug surveillance system. We investigated the data models from two prominent drug safety surveillance studies, the Mini-Sentinel program and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, and developed an EMR-based ADR common data model (EADR CDM). The EADR CDM has eight tables, including a demographic table, drug table, visit table, procedure table, diagnosis table, death table, laboratory table and organization table. Each table consists of 5-12 fields. Among a total of 2,931,060 patients from January 2008 to December 2012 in clinical data warehouse of the S hospital, we extracted the data from 135,745 patients who were prescribed below drugs to determine whether the exported data were sufficient to detect ADRs of six drugs. After validation, we found that the transformed data based on EADR CDM is helpful to understand the prescription pattern and explore feasible medication list for adverse drug signal detection. The collection of diverse data using the CDM is an effective method of early decision of ADRs. This study provides guidelines for developing the CDM and plans to develop the drug safety surveillance system based on multi-center EMR.

AB  - Background Generating synthetic patient data is crucial for medical research, but common approaches build up on black-box models which do not allow for expert verification or intervention. We propose a highly available method which enables synthetic data generation from real patient records in a privacy preserving and compliant fashion, is interpretable and allows for expert intervention.Methods Our approach ties together two established tools in medical informatics, namely OMOP as a data standard for electronic health records and Synthea as a data synthetization method. For this study, data pipelines were built which extract data from OMOP, convert them into time series format, learn temporal rules by 2 statistical algorithms (Markov chain, TARM) and 3 algorithms of causal discovery (DYNOTEARS, J-PCMCI+, LiNGAM) and map the outputs into Synthea graphs. The graphs are evaluated quantitatively by their individual and relative complexity and qualitatively by medical experts.Results The algorithms were found to learn qualitatively and quantitatively different graph representations. Whereas the Markov chain results in extremely large graphs, TARM, DYNOTEARS, and J-PCMCI+ were found to reduce the data dimension during learning. The MultiGroupDirect LiNGAM algorithm was found to not be applicable to the problem statement at hand.Conclusion Only TARM and DYNOTEARS are practical algorithms for real-world data in this use case. As causal discovery is a method to debias purely statistical relationships, the gradient-based causal discovery algorithm DYNOTEARS was found to be most suitable.

AB  - COVID-19 highlighted the need for use of real-world data (RWD) in critical care as a near real-time resource for clinical, research, and policy efforts. Analysis of RWD is gaining momentum and can generate important evidence for policy makers and regulators. Extracting high quality RWD from electronic health records (EHRs) requires sophisticated infrastructure and dedicated resources. We sought to customize freely available public tools, supporting all phases of data harmonization, from data quality assessments to de-identification procedures, and generation of robust, data science ready RWD from EHRs. These data are made available to clinicians and researchers through CURE ID, a free platform which facilitates access to case reports of challenging clinical cases and repurposed treatments hosted by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences/National Institutes of Health in partnership with the Food and Drug Administration. This commentary describes the partnership, rationale, process, use case, impact in critical care, and future directions for this collaborative effort.

AB  - PURPOSEThe specific aims of this paper are to (1) develop and operationalize an electronic health record (EHR) data quality framework, (2) apply the dimensions of the framework to the phenotype and treatment pathways of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) using All of Us Research Program data, and (3) propose and apply a checklist to evaluate the application of the framework. METHODSWe developed a framework of five data quality dimensions (DQD; completeness, concordance, conformance, plausibility, and temporality). Participants signed a consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization to share EHR data and responded to demographic questions in the Basics questionnaire. We evaluated the internal characteristics of the data and compared data with external benchmarks with descriptive and inferential statistics. We developed a DQD checklist to evaluate concept selection, internal verification, and external validity for each DQD. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) concept ID codes for DCIS were used to select a cohort of 2,209 females 18 years and older. RESULTSUsing the proposed DQD checklist criteria, (1) concepts were selected and internally verified for conformance; (2) concepts were selected and internally verified for completeness; (3) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for concordance; (4) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for plausibility; and (5) concepts were selected, internally verified, and externally validated for temporality. CONCLUSIONThis assessment and evaluation provided insights into data quality for the DCIS phenotype using EHR data from the All of Us Research Program. The review demonstrates that salient clinical measures can be selected, applied, and operationalized within a conceptual framework and evaluated for fitness for use by applying a proposed checklist.

TI  - ROMOP: a light-weight R package for interfacing with OMOP-formatted electronic health record data
T2  - JAMIA OPEN
LA  - English
KW  - MODELS
AB  - Objectives: Electronic health record (EHR) data are increasingly used for biomedical discoveries. The nature of the data, however, requires expertise in both data science and EHR structure. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) standardizes the language and structure of EHR data to promote interoperability of EHR data for research. While the OMOP CDM is valuable and more attuned to research purposes, it still requires extensive domain knowledge to utilize effectively, potentially limiting more widespread adoption of EHR data for research and quality improvement.
   Materials and methods: We have created ROMOP: an R package for direct interfacing with EHR data in the OMOP CDM format.
   Results: ROMOP streamlines typical EHR-related data processes. Its functions include exploration of data types, extraction and summarization of patient clinical and demographic data, and patient searches using any CDM vocabulary concept.
   Conclusion: ROMOP is freely available under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license and can be obtained from GitHub (http://github.com/BenGlicksberg/ROMOP). We detail instructions for setup and use in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we provide a public sandbox server containing synthesized clinical data for users to explore OMOP data and ROMOP (http://romop.ucsf.edu).

AB  - In recent years, there has been an emerging interest in the use of claims and electronic health record (EHR) data for evaluation of medical device safety and effectiveness. In Korea, national insurance electronic data interchange (EDI) code has been used as a medical device data source for common data model (CDM). This study performed a preliminary feasibility assessment of CDM-based vigilance. A cross-sectional study of target medical device data in EHR and CDM was conducted. A total of 155 medical devices were finally enrolled, with 58.7% of them having EDI codes. Femoral head prosthesis was selected as a focus group. It was registered in our institute with 11 EDI codes. However, only three EDI codes were converted to systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms concept. EDI code was matched in one-to-many (up to 104) with unique device identifier (UDI), including devices classified as different global medical device nomenclature. The use of UDI rather than EDI code as a medical device data source is recommended. We hope that this study will share the current state of medical device data recorded in the EHR and contribute to the introduction of CDM-based medical device vigilance by selecting appropriate medical device data sources.

AB  - The availability of large Electronic Health Records (EHR) databases has created new opportunities for clinical research. To improve interoperability of these databases a Common Data Model (CDM) can be used which enables standardized analytics. However, identifying the appropriate data sources for a specific study remains a challenge. The current strategy used for database discovery are based on catalogues that contain metadata which is often not rich enough for the task at hand. Additionally, sometimes this information is incorrect since it is inserted in such platforms manually by the data owners. In response to this challenge, we proposed the Concept Browser tool. The tool aims to streamline the process of efficiently exploring and selecting suitable OMOP CDM databases aligned with the study purpose. It was developed and validated in the EHDEN project, which currently contains information from more than ISO health databases across Europe and is now being used also in the DARWIN EU (R) initiative of the European Medicines Agency.

AB  - Background: A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is recognized as a technology that enhances clinical efficacy and safety. However, its full potential has not been realized, mainly due to clinical data standards and noninteroperable platforms. Objective: In this paper, we introduce the common data model-based intelligent algorithm network environment (CANE) platform that supports the implementation and deployment of a CDSS.
   Methods: CDSS reasoning engines, usually represented as R or Python objects, are deployed into the CANE platform and converted into C# objects. When a clinician requests CANE-based decision support in the electronic health record (EHR) system, patients' information is transformed into Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format and transmitted to the CANE server inside the hospital firewall. Upon receiving the necessary data, the CANE system's modules perform the following tasks: (1) the preprocessing module converts the FHIRs into the input data required by the specific reasoning engine, (2) the reasoning engine module operates the target algorithms, (3) the integration module communicates with the other institutions' CANE systems to request and transmit a summary report to aid in decision support, and (4) creates a user interface by integrating the summary report and the results calculated by the reasoning engine.
   Results: We developed a CANE system such that any algorithm implemented in the system can be directly called through the RESTful application programming interface when it is integrated with an EHR system. Eight algorithms were developed and deployed in the CANE system. Using a knowledge-based algorithm, physicians can screen patients who are prone to sepsis and obtain treatment guides for patients with sepsis with the CANE system. Further, using a nonknowledge-based algorithm, the CANE system supports emergency physicians' clinical decisions about optimum resource allocation by predicting a patient's acuity and prognosis during triage.
   Conclusions: We successfully developed a common data model-based platform that adheres to medical informatics standards and could aid artificial intelligence model deployment using R or Python.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many large-scale cardiovascular clinical trials are plagued with escalating costs and low enrollment. Implementing a computable phenotype, which is a set of executable algorithms, to identify a group of clinical characteristics derivable from electronic health records or administrative claims records, is essential to successful recruitment in large-scale pragmatic clinical trials. This methods paper provides an overview of the development and implementation of a computable phenotype in ADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: a Patient-Centric Trial Assessing Benefits and Long-Term Effectiveness)-a pragmatic, randomized, open-label clinical trial testing the optimal dose of aspirin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: A multidisciplinary team developed and tested the computable phenotype to identify adults >= 18 years of age with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease without safety concerns around using aspirin and meeting trial eligibility criteria. Using the computable phenotype, investigators identified over 650 000 potentially eligible patients from the 40 participating sites from Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network-a network of Clinical Data Research Networks, Patient-Powered Research Networks, and Health Plan Research Networks. Leveraging diverse recruitment methods, sites enrolled 15 076 participants from April 2016 to June 2019. During the process of developing and implementing the ADAPTABLE computable phenotype, several key lessons were learned. The accuracy and utility of a computable phenotype are dependent on the quality of the source data, which can be variable even with a common data model. Local validation and modification were required based on site factors, such as recruitment strategies, data quality, and local coding patterns. Sustained collaboration among a diverse team of researchers is needed during computable phenotype development and implementation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ADAPTABLE computable phenotype served as an efficient method to recruit patients in a multisite pragmatic clinical trial. This process of development and implementation will be informative for future large-scale, pragmatic clinical trials.

AB  - Objective: We present the Clinical Trial Knowledge Base, a regularly updated knowledge base of discrete clinical trial eligibility criteria equipped with a web-based user interface for querying and aggregate analysis of common eligibility criteria.
   Materials and methods: We used a natural language processing (NLP) tool named Criteria2Query (Yuan et al., 2019) to transform free text clinical trial eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov into discrete criteria concepts and attributes encoded using the widely adopted Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and stored in a relational SQL database. A web application accessible via RESTful APIs was implemented to enable queries and visual aggregate analyses. We demonstrate CTKB's potential role in EHR phenotype knowledge engineering using ten validated phenotyping algorithms.
   Results: At the time of writing, CTKB contained 87,504 distinctive OMOP CDM standard concepts, including Condition (47.82%), Drug (23.01%), Procedure (13.73%), Measurement (24.70%) and Observation (5.28%), with 34.78% for inclusion criteria and 65.22% for exclusion criteria, extracted from 352,110 clinical trials. The average hit rate of criteria concepts in eMERGE phenotype algorithms is 77.56%.
   Conclusion: CTKB is a novel comprehensive knowledge base of discrete eligibility criteria concepts with the potential to enable knowledge engineering for clinical trial cohort definition, clinical trial population representativeness assessment, electronical phenotyping, and data gap analyses for using electronic health records to support clinical trial recruitment.

AB  - Background: The association between dyslipidemia and asthma in children remains unclear.
   Purpose: This study investigated the association between dyslipidemia and cholesterol levels in children.
   Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies investigating the association between dyslipidemia and asthma in children. The PubMed database was searched for articles published from January 2000-March 2022. Data from a cohort study using electronic health records from 5 hospitals, converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), were used to identify the association between total cholesterol (TC) levels and asthma in children. This cohort study used the Cox proportional hazards model to examine hazard ratio (HR) of asthma after propensity score matching, and included an aggregate meta-analysis of HR.
   Results: We examined 11 studies reporting an association between dyslipidemia and asthma in children. Most were cross-sectional; however, their results were inconsistent. In OMOP-CDM multicenter analysis, the high TC (>170 mg/dL) group included 29,038 children, while the normal TC (<= 170 mg/dL) group included 88,823 children including all hospital datasets. In a meta-analysis of this multicenter cohort, a significant association was found between high TC levels and later development of asthma in children <15 years of age (pooled HR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.52).
   Conclusion: Elevated TC levels in children may be associated with asthma.

AB  - Introduction: Health systems spend $1.5 billion annually reporting data on quality, but efficacy and utility for benchmarking are limited due, in part, to limitations of data sources. Our objective was to implement and evaluate measures of pediatric quality for three conditions using electronic health record (EHR)-derived data. Methods: PCORnet networks standardized EHR-derived data to a common data model. In 13 health systems from 2 networks for 2015, we implemented the National Quality Forum measures: % children with sickle cell anemia who received a transcranial Doppler; % children on antipsychotics who had metabolic screening; and % pediatric acute otitis media with amoxicillin prescribed. Manual chart review assessed measure accuracy. Results: Only 39% (N = 2,923) of 7,278 children on antipsychotics received metabolic screening (range: 20%-54%). If the measure indicated screening was performed, the chart agreed 88% of the time [95% confidence interval (CI): 81%-94%]; if it indicated screening was not done, the chart agreed 86% (95% CI: 78%-93%). Only 69% (N = 793) of 1,144 children received transcranial Doppler screening (range across sites: 49%-88%). If the measure indicated screening was performed, the chart agreed 98% of the time (95% CI: 94%-100%); if it indicated screening was not performed, the chart agreed 89% (95% CI: 82%-95%). For acute otitis media, chart review identified many qualifying cases missed by the National Quality Forum measure, which excluded a common diagnostic code. Conclusions: Measures of healthcare quality developed using EHR-derived data were valid and identified wide variation among network sites. This data can facilitate the identification and spread of best practices.

AB  - Purpose Using real-world data to support regulatory decision has become a global movement. However, a robust platform for active surveillance of medical product safety has not been established in Taiwan.
   Methods Following the common data model structure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System, we built the Taiwan Sentinel Data Model (TSDM) using the National Health Insurance Research Database with longitudinal claims data from 23 million individuals, linked death and cause of death data from a national registry, and linked electronic health record data from a delivery system. We examined the conversion of the TSDM using the Sentinel Data Quality Review and Characterization Programs in a sample of sex- and age-stratified cohort of 3 million individuals.
   Results The TSDM fulfilled the requirements of data quality assurance. Only about 6% of sex and 0.0007% of birth year were missing, and <0.001% of date data had illogical values.
   Conclusions The TSDM-converted database could be a valuable data resource for domestic pharmacovigilance analysis in Taiwan and cross-country evaluation.

AB  - Background: Implementation of phenotype algorithms requires phenotype engineers to interpret human-readable algorithms and translate the description (text and flowcharts) into computable phenotypes - a process that can be labor intensive and error prone. To address the critical need for reducing the implementation efforts, it is important to develop portable algorithms.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of phenotype algorithms developed in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network and identified common customization tasks required for implementation. A novel scoring system was developed to quantify portability from three aspects: Knowledge conversion, clause Interpretation, and Programming (KIP). Tasks were grouped into twenty representative categories. Experienced phenotype engineers were asked to estimate the average time spent on each category and evaluate time saving enabled by a common data model (CDM), specifically the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) model, for each category.
   Results: A total of 485 distinct clauses (phenotype criteria) were identified from 55 phenotype algorithms, corresponding to 1153 customization tasks. In addition to 25 non-phenotype-specific tasks, 46 tasks are related to interpretation, 613 tasks are related to knowledge conversion, and 469 tasks are related to programming. A score between 0 and 2 (0 for easy, 1 for moderate, and 2 for difficult portability) is assigned for each aspect, yielding a total KIP score range of 0 to 6. The average clause-wise KIP score to reflect portability is 1.37 +/- 1.38. Specifically, the average knowledge (K) score is 0.64 +/- 0.66, interpretation (I) score is 0.33 +/- 0.55, and programming (P) score is 0.40 +/- 0.64. 5% of the categories can be completed within one hour (median). 70% of the categories take from days to months to complete. The OMOP model can assist with vocabulary mapping tasks.
   Conclusion: This study presents firsthand knowledge of the substantial implementation efforts in phenotyping and introduces a novel metric (KIP) to measure portability of phenotype algorithms for quantifying such efforts across the eMERGE Network. Phenotype developers are encouraged to analyze and optimize the portability in regards to knowledge, interpretation and programming. CDMs can be used to improve the portability for some 'knowledge-oriented' tasks.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the benefits of converting Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to a common data model (CDM) and to assess the potential of CDM-converted data to rapidly generate insights for benefitrisk assessments in post-market regulatory evaluation and decisions. Methods: EMRs from January 2013 to December 2016 were mapped onto the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-CDM (OMOP-CDM) schema. Vocabulary mappings were applied to convert source data values into OMOP-CDM-endorsed terminologies. Existing analytic codes used in a prior OMOP-CDM drug utilization study were modified to conduct an illustrative analysis of oral anticoagulants used for atrial fibrillation in Singapore and South Korea, resembling a typical benefit-risk assessment. A novel visualization is proposed to represent the comparative effectiveness, safety and utilization of the drugs. Results: Over 90% of records were mapped onto the OMOP-CDM. The CDM data structures and analytic code templates simplified the querying of data for the analysis. In total, 2,419 patients from Singapore and South Korea fulfilled the study criteria, the majority of whom were warfarin users. After 3 months of follow-up, differences in cumulative incidence of bleeding and thromboembolic events were observable via the proposed visualization, surfacing insights as to the agent of preference in a given clinical setting, which may meaningfully inform regulatory decision-making. Conclusions: While the structure of the OMOP-CDM and its accessory tools facilitate real-world data analysis, extending them to fulfil regulatory analytic purposes in the post-market setting, such as benefit-risk assessments, may require layering on additional analytic tools and visualization techniques.

AB  - Objective: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for timely data from the healthcare systems for research. To meet this need, several large new data consortia have been developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform, and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks have increased. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands.
   Methods: In this article, we describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19.
   Results: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and postprocessing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature.
   Conclusions: The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act and could greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research.

AB  - Background: Cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) result in 17.5 million deaths annually worldwide, accounting for 46.2% of noncommunicable causes of death, and are the leading cause of death, followed by cancer, respiratory disease, and diabetes mellitus. Coronary artery computed tomography angiography (CCTA), which detects calcification in the coronary arteries, can be used to detect asymptomatic but serious vascular disease. It allows for noninvasive and quick testing despite involving radiation exposure.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of CCTA screening on CVD outcomes by using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) data and the population-level estimation method.
   Methods: Using electronic health record-based OMOP-CDM data, including health questionnaire responses, adults (aged 30-74 years) without a history of CVD were selected, and 5-year CVD outcomes were compared between patients undergoing CCTA (target group) and a comparison group via 1:1 propensity score matching. Participants were stratified into low-risk and high-risk groups based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score and Framingham risk score (FRS) for subgroup analyses.
   Results: The 2-year and 5-year risk scores were compared as secondary outcomes between the two groups. In total, 8787 participants were included in both the target group and comparison group. No significant differences (calibration P=.37) were found between the hazard ratios of the groups at 5 years. The subgroup analysis also revealed no significant differences between the ASCVD risk scores and FRSs of the groups at 5 years (ASCVD risk score: P=.97; FRS: P=.85). However, the CCTA group showed a significantly lower increase in risk scores at 2 years (ASCVD risk score: P=.03; FRS: P=.02).
   Conclusions: Although we could not confirm a significant difference in the preventive effects of CCTA screening for CVDs over a long period of 5 years, it may have a beneficial effect on risk score management over 2 years.

AB  - Background: Electronic health records (EHRs, such as those created by an anesthesia management system) generate a large amount of data that can notably be reused for clinical audits and scientific research. The sharing of these data and tools is generally affected by the lack of system interoperability. To overcome these issues, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) developed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to standardize EHR data and promote large-scale observational and longitudinal research. Anesthesia data have not previously been mapped into the OMOP CDM.
   Objective: The primary objective was to transform anesthesia data into the OMOP CDM. The secondary objective was to provide vocabularies, queries, and dashboards that might promote the exploitation and sharing of anesthesia data through the CDM.
   Methods: Using our local anesthesia data warehouse, a group of 5 experts from 5 different medical centers identified local concepts related to anesthesia. The concepts were then matched with standard concepts in the OHDSI vocabularies. We performed structural mapping between the design of our local anesthesia data warehouse and the OMOP CDM tables and fields. To validate the implementation of anesthesia data into the OMOP CDM, we developed a set of queries and dashboards.
   Results: We identified 522 concepts related to anesthesia care. They were classified as demographics, units, measurements, operating room steps, drugs, periods of interest, and features. After semantic mapping, 353 (67.7%) of these anesthesia concepts were mapped to OHDSI concepts. Further, 169 (32.3%) concepts related to periods and features were added to the OHDSI vocabularies. Then, 8 OMOP CDM tables were implemented with anesthesia data and 2 new tables (EPISODE and FEATURE) were added to store secondarily computed data. We integrated data from 5,72,609 operations and provided the code for a set of 8 queries and 4 dashboards related to anesthesia care.
   Conclusions: Generic data concerning demographics, drugs, units, measurements, and operating room steps were already available in OHDSI vocabularies. However, most of the intraoperative concepts (the duration of specific steps, an episode of hypotension, etc) were not present in OHDSI vocabularies. The OMOP mapping provided here enables anesthesia data reuse.

AB  - Integrating advanced data processing technologies into healthcare has shifted the medical studies paradigm. These evolve from data collection into management and analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. This change improved patient care and expanded the scope of clinical research through the secondary usage of existing data. Even though this problem was already solved in other initiatives, it raised new challenges, namely regarding cohort definition, data discovery, and evaluating the study feasibility. There are database catalogues to help in those tasks, but these fail in some cases due to insufficient information. Therefore, in this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a baseline method for information retrieval, including a synthetic dataset for further research. The information present in the dataset was generated from metadata extracted from real-world databases, which represents real problems that do not yet have a solution.

AB  - Background: The reuse of data from electronic health records (EHRs) for research purposes promises to improve the data foundation for clinical trials and may even support to enable them. Nevertheless, EHRs are characterized by both, heterogeneous structure and semantics. To standardize this data for research, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) standard has recently seen an increase in use. However, the conversion of these EHRs into the OMOP CDM requires complex and resource intensive Extract Transform and Load (ETL) processes. This hampers the reuse of clinical data for research. To solve the issues of heterogeneity of EHRs and the lack of semantic precision on the care site, the openEHR standard has recently seen wider adoption. A standardized process to integrate openEHR records into the CDM potentially lowers the barriers of making EHRs accessible for research. Yet, a comprehensive approach about the integration of openEHR records into the OMOP CDM has not yet been made. Methods: We analyzed both standards and compared their models to identify possible mappings. Based on this, we defined the necessary processes to transform openEHR records into CDM tables. We also discuss the limitation of openEHR with its unspecific demographics model and propose two possible solutions.Results: We developed the OMOP Conversion Language (OMOCL) which enabled us to define a declarative openEHR archetype-to-CDM mapping language. Using OMOCL, it was possible to define a set of mappings. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the Eos tool, which uses the OMOCL-files to successfully automatize the ETL from real-world and sample EHRs into the OMOP CDM.Discussion: Both Eos and OMOCL provide a way to define generic mappings for an integration of openEHR records into OMOP. Thus, it represents a significant step towards achieving interoperability between the clinical and the research data domains. However, the transformation of openEHR data into the less expressive OMOP CDM leads to a loss of semantics.

AB  - Background: In the era of big data, the intensive care unit (ICU) is likely to benefit from real-time computer analysis and modeling based on close patient monitoring and electronic health record data. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) is the first open access database in the ICU domain. Many studies have shown that common data models (CDMs) improve database searching by allowing code, tools, and experience to be shared. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is spreading all over the world. Objective: The objective was to transform MIMIC into an OMOP database and to evaluate the benefits of this transformation for analysts. Methods: We transformed MIMIC (version 1.4.21) into OMOP format (version 5.3.3.1) through semantic and structural mapping. The structural mapping aimed at moving the MIMIC data into the right place in OMOP, with some data transformations. The mapping was divided into 3 phases: conception, implementation, and evaluation. The conceptual mapping aimed at aligning the MIMIC local terminologies to OMOP's standard ones. It consisted of 3 phases: integration, alignment, and evaluation. A documented, tested, versioned, exemplified, and open repository was set up to support the transformation and improvement of the MIMIC community's source code. The resulting data set was evaluated over a 48-hour datathon. Results: With an investment of 2 people for 500 hours, 64% of the data items of the 26 MIMIC tables were standardized into the OMOP CDM and 78% of the source concepts mapped to reference terminologies. The model proved its ability to support community contributions and was well received during the datathon, with 160 participants and 15,000 requests executed with a Conclusions: The resulting MIMIC-OMOP data set is the first MIMIC-OMOP data set available free of charge with real disidentified data ready for replicable intensive care research. This approach can be generalized to any medical field.

AB  - Objective Reinventing data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) to meet new analytical needs is slow and expensive. However, each new data research network that wishes to support its own analytics tends to develop its own data model. Joining these different networks without new data extraction, transform, and load (ETL) processes can reduce the time and expense needed to participate. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project supports data network interoperability through an ontology-driven approach. We use i2b2 as a hub, to rapidly reconfigure data to meet new analytical requirements without new ETL programming.
   Materials and Methods Our 12-site National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) uses i2b2 to query data. We developed a process to generate a PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM) physical database directly from existing i2b2 systems, thereby supporting PCORnet analytic queries without new ETL programming. This involved: a formalized process for representing i2b2 information models (the specification of data types and formats); an information model that represents CDM Version 1.0; and a program that generates CDM tables, driven by this information model. This approach is generalizable to any logical information model.
   Results Eight PCORnet CDRN sites have implemented this approach and generated a CDM database without a new ETL process from the EHR. This enables federated querying within the CDRN and compatibility with the national PCORnet Distributed Research Network.
   Discussion We have established a way to adapt i2b2 to new information models without requiring changes to the underlying data. Eight Scalable Collaborative Infrastructure for a Learning Health System sites vetted this methodology, resulting in a network that, at present, supports research on 10 million patients' data.
   Conclusion New analytical requirements can be quickly and cost-effectively supported by i2b2 without creating new data extraction processes from the EHR.

AB  - Background: The content of the clinical notes that have been continuously collected along patients' health history has the potential to provide relevant information about treatments and diseases, and to increase the value of structured data available in Electronic Health Records (EHR) databases. EHR databases are currently being used in observational studies which lead to important findings in medical and biomedical sciences. However, the information present in clinical notes is not being used in those studies, since the computational analysis of this unstructured data is much complex in comparison to structured data. Methods: We propose a two-stage workflow for solving an existing gap in Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) procedures regarding observational databases. The first stage of the workflow extracts prescriptions present in patient's clinical notes, while the second stage harmonises the extracted information into their standard definition and stores the resulting information in a common database schema used in observational studies. Results: We validated this methodology using two distinct data sets, in which the goal was to extract and store drug related information in a new Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) database. We analysed the performance of the used annotator as well as its limitations. Finally, we described some practical examples of how users can explore these datasets once migrated to OMOP CDM databases. Conclusion: With this methodology, we were able to show a strategy for using the information extracted from the clinical notes in business intelligence tools, or for other applications such as data exploration through the use of SQL queries. Besides, the extracted information complements the data present in OMOP CDM databases which was not directly available in the EHR database.

AB  - Introduction: Efficient methods to obtain and benchmark national data are needed to improve comparative quality assessment for children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). PCORnet is a network of clinical data research networks whose infrastructure includes standardization to a Common Data Model (CDM) incorporating electronic health record (EHR)-derived data across multiple clinical institutions. The study aimed to determine the feasibility of the automated use of EHR data to assess comparative quality for T1D. Methods: In two PCORnet networks, PEDSnet and OneFlorida, the study assessed measures of glycemic control, diabetic ketoacidosis admissions, and clinic visits in 2016-2018 among youth 0-20 years of age. The study team developed measure EHR-based specifications, identified institution-specific rates using data stored in the CDM, and assessed agreement with manual chart review. Results: Among 9,740 youth with T1D across 12 institutions, one quarter (26%) had two or more measures of A1c greater than 9% annually (min 5%, max 47%). The median A1c was 8.5% (min site 7.9, max site 10.2). Overall, 4% were hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis (min 2%, max 8%). The predictive value of the PCORnet CDM was >75% for all measures and >90% for three measures. Conclusions: Using EHR-derived data to assess comparative quality for T1D is a valid, efficient, and reliable data collection tool for measuring T1D care and outcomes. Wide variations across institutions were observed, and even the best-performing institutions often failed to achieve the American Diabetes Association HbA1C goals (<7.5%).

AB  - Background The increasing availability of molecular and clinical data of cancer patients combined with novel machine learning techniques has the potential to enhance clinical decision support, example, for assessing a patient's relapse risk. While these prediction models often produce promising results, a deployment in clinical settings is rarely pursued.
   Objectives In this study, we demonstrate how prediction tools can be integrated generically into a clinical setting and provide an exemplary use case for predicting relapse risk in melanoma patients.
   Methods To make the decision support architecture independent of the electronic health record (EHR) and transferable to different hospital environments, it was based on the widely used Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) rather than on a proprietary EHR data structure. The usability of our exemplary implementation was evaluated by means of conducting user interviews including the thinking-aloud protocol and the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire.
   Results An extract-transform-load process was developed to extract relevant clinical and molecular data from their original sources and map them to OMOP. Further, the OMOP WebAPI was adapted to retrieve all data for a single patient and transfer them into the decision support Web application for enabling physicians to easily consult the prediction service including monitoring of transferred data. The evaluation of the application resulted in a SUS score of 86.7.
   Conclusion This work proposes an EHR-independent means of integrating prediction models for deployment in clinical settings, utilizing the OMOP CDM. The usability evaluation revealed that the application is generally suitable for routine use while also illustrating small aspects for improvement.

AB  - Background Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are regarded as a major cause of death and a major contributor to public health costs. For the active surveillance of drug safety, the use of real-world data and real-world evidence as part of the overall pharmacovigilance process is important. In this regard, many studies apply the data-driven approaches to support pharmacovigilance. We developed a pharmacovigilance data-processing pipeline (PDP) that utilized electronic health records (EHR) and spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data to explore pharmacovigilance signals. Methods To this end, we integrated two medical data sources: Konyang University Hospital (KYUH) EHR and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). As part of the presented PDP, we converted EHR data on the Observation Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. To evaluate the ability of using the proposed PDP for pharmacovigilance purposes, we performed a statistical validation using drugs that induce ear disorders. Results To validate the presented PDP, we extracted six drugs from the EHR that were significantly involved in ADRs causing ear disorders: nortriptyline, (hazard ratio [HR] 8.06, 95% CI 2.41-26.91); metoclopramide (HR 3.35, 95% CI 3.01-3.74); doxycycline (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.14-2.62); digoxin (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08-2.38); acetaminophen (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.47-1.72); and sucralfate (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06-1.38). In FAERS, the strongest associations were found for nortriptyline (reporting odds ratio [ROR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.73-2.16), sucralfate (ROR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.45), doxycycline (ROR 1.30, 95% CI 1.20-1.40), and hydroxyzine (ROR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29). We confirmed the results in a meta-analysis using random and fixed models for doxycycline, hydroxyzine, metoclopramide, nortriptyline, and sucralfate. Conclusions The proposed PDP could support active surveillance and the strengthening of potential ADR signals via real-world data sources. In addition, the PDP was able to generate real-world evidence for drug safety.

TI  - Development and validation of a prognostic model predicting symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation in acute ischemic stroke at scale in the OHDSI network
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - COMMON DATA MODEL
AB  - Background and purpose
   Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after cerebral infarction is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon in the acute stage of ischemic stroke, and often results in a poor prognosis. Thus, identifying risk factors and making an early prediction of HT in acute cerebral infarction contributes not only to the selections of therapeutic regimen but also, more importantly, to the improvement of prognosis of acute cerebral infarction. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a model to predict a patient's risk of HT within 30 days of initial ischemic stroke.
   Methods
   We utilized a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study design to develop a Lasso Logistic Regression prediction model with a large, US Electronic Health Record data-set which structured to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). To examine clinical transportability, the model was externally validated across 10 additional real-world healthcare datasets include EHR records for patients from America, Europe and Asia.
   Results
   In the database the model was developed, the target population cohort contained 621,178 patients with ischemic stroke, of which 5,624 patients had HT within 30 days following initial ischemic stroke. 612 risk predictors, including the distance a patient travels in an ambulance to get to care for a HT, were identified. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 was achieved in the internal validation of the risk model. External validation was performed across 10 databases totaling 5,515,508 patients with ischemic stroke, of which 86,401 patients had HT within 30 days following initial ischemic stroke. The mean external AUC was 0.71 and ranged between 0.60-0.78.
   Conclusions
   A HT prognostic predict model was developed with Lasso Logistic Regression based on routinely collected EMR data. This model can identify patients who have a higher risk of HT than the population average with an AUC of 0.78. It shows the OMOP CDM is an appropriate data standard for EMR secondary use in clinical multicenter research for prognostic prediction model development and validation. In the future, combining this model with clinical information systems will assist clinicians to make the right therapy decision for patients with acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - The Health-Analytics Data to Evidence Suite (HADES) is an open-source software collection developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI). It executes directly against healthcare data such as electronic health records and administrative claims, that have been converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. Using advanced analytics, HADES performs characterization, population-level causal effect estimation, and patient-level prediction, potentially across a federated data network, allowing patient-level data to remain locally while only aggregated statistics are shared. Designed to run across a wide array of technical environments, including different operating systems and database platforms, HADES uses continuous integration with a large set of unit tests to maintain reliability. HADES implements OHDSI best practices, and is used in almost all published OHDSI studies, including some that have directly informed regulatory decisions.

AB  - Purpose Computable phenotypes are constructed to utilize data within the electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients with specific characteristics; a necessary step for researching a complex disease state. We developed computable phenotypes for resistant hypertension (RHTN) and stable controlled hypertension (HTN) based on the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) common data model (CDM). The computable phenotypes were validated through manual chart review. Methods We adapted and refined existing computable phenotype algorithms for RHTN and stable controlled HTN to the PCORnet CDM in an adult HTN population from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium (2015-2017). Two independent reviewers validated the computable phenotypes through manual chart review of 425 patient records. We assessed precision of our computable phenotypes through positive predictive value (PPV) and test validity through interrater reliability (IRR). Results Among the 156 730 HTN patients in our final dataset, the final computable phenotype algorithms identified 24 926 patients with RHTN and 19 100 with stable controlled HTN. The PPV for RHTN in patients randomly selected for validation of the final algorithm was 99.1% (n = 113, CI: 95.2%-99.9%). The PPV for stable controlled HTN in patients randomly selected for validation of the final algorithm was 96.5% (n = 113, CI: 91.2%-99.0%). IRR analysis revealed a raw percent agreement of 91% (152/167) with Cohen's kappa statistic = 0.87. Conclusions We constructed and validated a RHTN computable phenotype algorithm and a stable controlled HTN computable phenotype algorithm. Both algorithms are based on the PCORnet CDM, allowing for future application to epidemiological and drug utilization based research.

AB  - Introduction Transparency and traceability are essential for establishing trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). The lack of transparency in the data preparation process is a significant obstacle in developing reliable AI systems which can lead to issues related to reproducibility, debugging AI models, bias and fairness, and compliance and regulation. We introduce a formal data preparation pipeline specification to improve upon the manual and error-prone data extraction processes used in AI and data analytics applications, with a focus on traceability.Methods We propose a declarative language to define the extraction of AI-ready datasets from health data adhering to a common data model, particularly those conforming to HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). We utilize the FHIR profiling to develop a common data model tailored to an AI use case to enable the explicit declaration of the needed information such as phenotype and AI feature definitions. In our pipeline model, we convert complex, high-dimensional electronic health records data represented with irregular time series sampling to a flat structure by defining a target population, feature groups and final datasets. Our design considers the requirements of various AI use cases from different projects which lead to implementation of many feature types exhibiting intricate temporal relations.Results We implement a scalable and high-performant feature repository to execute the data preparation pipeline definitions. This software not only ensures reliable, fault-tolerant distributed processing to produce AI-ready datasets and their metadata including many statistics alongside, but also serve as a pluggable component of a decision support application based on a trained AI model during online prediction to automatically prepare feature values of individual entities. We deployed and tested the proposed methodology and the implementation in three different research projects. We present the developed FHIR profiles as a common data model, feature group definitions and feature definitions within a data preparation pipeline while training an AI model for "predicting complications after cardiac surgeries".Discussion Through the implementation across various pilot use cases, it has been demonstrated that our framework possesses the necessary breadth and flexibility to define a diverse array of features, each tailored to specific temporal and contextual criteria.

AB  - Background: Efficiently sharing health data produced during standard care could dramatically accelerate progress in cancer treatments, but various barriers make this difficult. Not sharing these data to ensure patient privacy is at the cost of little to no learning from real-world data produced during cancer care. Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated a willingness of patients with cancer to share their treatment experiences to fuel research, despite potential risks to privacy.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to design, pilot, and release a decentralized, scalable, efficient, economical, and secure strategy for the dissemination of deidentified clinical and genomic data with a focus on late-stage cancer.
   Methods: We created and piloted a blockchain-authenticated system to enable secure sharing of deidentified patient data derived from standard of care imaging, genomic testing, and electronic health records (EHRs), called the Cancer Gene Trust (CGT). We prospectively consented and collected data for a pilot cohort (N=18), which we uploaded to the CGT. EHR data were extracted from both a hospital cancer registry and a common data model (CDM) format to identify optimal data extraction and dissemination practices. Specifically, we scored and compared the level of completeness between two EHR data extraction formats against the gold standard source documentation for patients with available data (n=17).
   Results: Although the total completeness scores were greater for the registry reports than those for the CDM, this difference was not statistically significant. We did find that some specific data fields, such as histology site, were better captured using the registry reports, which can be used to improve the continually adapting CDM. In terms of the overall pilot study, we found that CGT enables rapid integration of real-world data of patients with cancer in a more clinically useful time frame. We also developed an open-source Web application to allow users to seamlessly search, browse, explore, and download CGT data.
   Conclusions: Our pilot demonstrates the willingness of patients with cancer to participate in data sharing and how blockchain-enabled structures can maintain relationships between individual data elements while preserving patient privacy, empowering findings by third-party researchers and clinicians. We demonstrate the feasibility of CGT as a framework to share health data trapped in silos to further cancer research. Further studies to optimize data representation, stream, and integrity are required.

TI  - The OMOP common data model in Australian primary care data: Building a quality research ready harmonised dataset
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - RECORDS
AB  - Background
   The use of routinely collected health data for secondary research purposes is increasingly recognised as a methodology that advances medical research, improves patient outcomes, and guides policy. This secondary data, as found in electronic medical records (EMRs), can be optimised through conversion into a uniform data structure to enable analysis alongside other comparable health metric datasets. This can be achieved with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), which employs a standardised vocabulary to facilitate systematic analysis across various observational databases. The concept behind the OMOP-CDM is the conversion of data into a common format through the harmonisation of terminologies, vocabularies, and coding schemes within a unique repository. The OMOP model enhances research capacity through the development of shared analytic and prediction techniques; pharmacovigilance for the active surveillance of drug safety; and 'validation' analyses across multiple institutions across Australia, the United States, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. In this research, we aim to investigate the use of the open-source OMOP-CDM in the PATRON primary care data repository.
   Methods
   We used standard structured query language (SQL) to construct, extract, transform, and load scripts to convert the data to the OMOP-CDM. The process of mapping distinct free-text terms extracted from various EMRs presented a substantial challenge, as many terms could not be automatically matched to standard vocabularies through direct text comparison. This resulted in a number of terms that required manual assignment. To address this issue, we implemented a strategy where our clinical mappers were instructed to focus only on terms that appeared with sufficient frequency. We established a specific threshold value for each domain, ensuring that more than 95% of all records were linked to an approved vocabulary like SNOMED once appropriate mapping was completed. To assess the data quality of the resultant OMOP dataset we utilised the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard (DQD) to evaluate the plausibility, conformity, and comprehensiveness of the data in the PATRON repository according to the Kahn framework.
   Results
   Across three primary care EMR systems we converted data on 2.03 million active patients to version 5.4 of the OMOP common data model. The DQD assessment involved a total of 3,570 individual evaluations. Each evaluation compared the outcome against a predefined threshold. A 'FAIL' occurred when the percentage of non-compliant rows exceeded the specified threshold value. In this assessment of the primary care OMOP database described here, we achieved an overall pass rate of 97%.
   Conclusion
   The OMOP CDM's widespread international use, support, and training provides a well-established pathway for data standardisation in collaborative research. Its compatibility allows the sharing of analysis packages across local and international research groups, which facilitates rapid and reproducible data comparisons. A suite of open-source tools, including the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard (Version 1.4.1), supports the model. Its simplicity and standards-based approach facilitates adoption and integration into existing data processes.

AB  - Background: Utilization of the available observational healthcare datasets is key to complement and strengthen the postmarketing safety studies. Use of common data models (CDM) is the predominant approach in order to enable large scale systematic analyses on disparate data models and vocabularies. Current CDM transformation practices depend on proprietarily developed Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) procedures, which require knowledge both on the semantics and technical characteristics of the source datasets and target CDM.
   Purpose: In this study, our aim is to develop a modular but coordinated transformation approach in order to separate semantic and technical steps of transformation processes, which do not have a strict separation in traditional ETL approaches. Such an approach would discretize the operations to extract data from source electronic health record systems, alignment of the source, and target models on the semantic level and the operations to populate target common data repositories.
   Approach: In order to separate the activities that are required to transform heterogeneous data sources to a target CDM, we introduce a semantic transformation approach composed of three steps: (1) transformation of source datasets to Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, (2) application of semantic conversion rules to get the data as instances of ontological model of the target CDM, and (3) population of repositories, which comply with the specifications of the CDM, by processing the RDF instances from step 2. The proposed approach has been implemented on real healthcare settings where Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM has been chosen as the common data model and a comprehensive comparative analysis between the native and transformed data has been conducted.
   Results: Health records of similar to 1 million patients have been successfully transformed to an OMOP CDM based database from the source database. Descriptive statistics obtained from the source and target databases present analogous and consistent results.
   Discussion and Conclusion: Our method goes beyond the traditional ETL approaches by being more declarative and rigorous. Declarative because the use of RDF based mapping rules makes each mapping more transparent and understandable to humans while retaining logic-based computability. Rigorous because the mappings would be based on computer readable semantics which are amenable to validation through logic-based inference methods.

AB  - Introduction Electronic healthcare databases (EHDs) are used increasingly for post-marketing drug safety surveillance and pharmacoepidemiology in Europe and North America. However, few studies have examined the potential of these data sources in China.
   Methods Three major types of EHDs in China (i.e., a regional community-based database, a national claims database, and an electronic medical records [EMR] database) were selected for evaluation. Forty core variables were derived based on the US Mini-Sentinel (MS) Common Data Model (CDM) as well as the data features in China that would be desirable to support drug safety surveillance. An email survey of these core variables and eight general questions as well as follow-up inquiries on additional variables was conducted. These 40 core variables across the three EHDs and all variables in each EHD along with those in the US MS CDM and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM were compared for availability and labeled based on specific standards.
   Results All of the EHDs' custodians confirmed their willingness to share their databases with academic institutions after appropriate approval was obtained. The regional community-based database contained 1.19 million people in 2015 with 85% of core variables. Resampled annually nationwide, the national claims database included 5.4 million people in 2014 with 55% of core variables, and the EMR database included 3 million inpatients from 60 hospitals in 2015 with 80% of core variables. Compared with MS CDM or OMOP CDM, the proportion of variables across the three EHDs available or able to be transformed/derived from the original sources are 24-83% or 45-73%, respectively.
   Conclusions These EHDs provide potential value to post-marketing drug safety surveillance and pharmacoepidemiology in China. Future research is warranted to assess the quality and completeness of these EHDs or additional data sources in China.

AB  - Introduction: Quality indicators play an essential role in a learning health system. They help healthcare providers to monitor the quality and safety of care delivered and to identify areas for improvement. Clinical quality indicators, therefore, need to be based on real world data. Generating reliable and actionable data routinely is challenging. Healthcare data are often stored in different formats and use different terminologies and coding systems, making it difficult to generate and compare indicator reports from different sources.Methods: The Observational Health Sciences and Informatics community maintains the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP). This is an open data standard providing a computable and interoperable format for real world data. We implemented a Computable Biomedical Knowledge Object (CBK) in the Piano Platform based on OMOP. The CBK calculates an inpatient quality indicator and was illustrated using synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data in the open OMOP standard.Results: The CBK reported the in-hospital mortality of patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the synthetic EHR dataset and includes interactive visualizations and the results of calculations. Value sets composed of OMOP concept codes for AMI and comorbidities used in the indicator calculation were also created.Conclusion: Computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) objects that operate on OMOP data can be reused across datasets that conform to OMOP. With OMOP being a widely used interoperability standard, quality indicators embedded in CBKs can accelerate the generation of evidence for targeted quality and safety management, improving care to benefit larger populations.

KW  - DISCOVERY
AB  - Background and objectiveRecently, Electronic Health Records (EHR) are increasingly being converted to Common Data Models (CDMs), a database schema designed to provide standardized vocabularies to facilitate collaborative observational research. To date, however, rare attempts exist to leverage CDM data for healthcare process mining, a technique to derive process-related knowledge (e.g., process model) from event logs. This paper presents a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM for process mining and demonstrates CDM-based healthcare process mining with several real-life study cases while answering frequently posed questions in process mining, in the CDM environment. MethodsWe propose a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the OMOP CDM for process types including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room processes, and patient journey. Using the proposed method, we extract the retrospective data of several surgical procedure cases (i.e., Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH), Total Hip Replacement (THR), Coronary Bypass (CB), Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD)) from the CDM of a Korean tertiary hospital. Patient data are extracted for each of the operations and analyzed using several process mining techniques. ResultsUsing process mining, the clinical pathways, outpatient process models, emergency room process models, and patient journeys are demonstrated using the extracted logs. The result shows CDM's usability as a novel and valuable data source for healthcare process analysis, yet with a few considerations. We found that CDM should be complemented by different internal and external data sources to address the administrative and operational aspects of healthcare processes, particularly for outpatient and ER process analyses. ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit CDM for healthcare process mining. Specifically, we provide a step-by-step guidance by demonstrating process analysis from locating relevant CDM tables to visualizing results using process mining tools. The proposed method can be widely applicable across different institutions. This work can contribute to bringing a process mining perspective to the existing CDM users in the changing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) environment and also to facilitating CDM-based studies in the process mining research community.

AB  - The ASH Research Collaborative is a nonprofit organization established through the American Society of Hematology's commitment to patients with hematologic conditions and the science that informs clinical care and future therapies. The ASH Research Collaborative houses 2 major initiatives: (1) the Data Hub and (2) the Clinical Trials Network (CTN). The Data Hub is a program for hematologic diseases in which networks of clinical care delivery sites are developed in specific disease areas, with individual patient data contributed through electronic health record (EHR) integration, direct data entry through electronic data capture, and external data sources. Disease-specific data models are constructed so that data can be assembled into analytic datasets and used to enhance clinical care through dashboards and other mechanisms. Initial models have been built in multiple myeloma (MM) and sickle cell disease (SCD) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. The Data Hub also provides a framework for development of disease-specific learning communities (LC) and testing of health care delivery strategies. The ASH Research Collaborative SCD CTN is a clinical trials accelerator that creates efficiencies in the execution of multicenter clinical trials and has been initially developed for SCD.

AB  - Background: The anonymization of Common Data Model (CDM)-converted EHR data is essential to ensure the data privacy in the use of harmonized health care data. However, applying data anonymization techniques can significantly affect many properties of the resulting data sets and thus biases research results. Few studies have reviewed these applications with a reflection of approaches to manage data utility and quality concerns in the context of CDM-formatted health care data.Objective: Our intended scoping review aims to identify and describe (1) how formal anonymization methods are carried out with CDM-converted health care data, (2) how data quality and utility concerns are considered, and (3) how the various CDMs differ in terms of their suitability for recording anonymized data. Methods: The planned scoping review is based on the framework of Arksey and O'Malley. By using this, only articles published in English will be included. The retrieval of literature items should be based on a literature search string combining keywords related to data anonymization, CDM standards, and data quality assessment. The proposed literature search query should be validated by a librarian, accompanied by manual searches to include further informal sources. Eligible articles will first undergo a deduplication step, followed by the screening of titles. Second, a full-text reading will allow the 2 reviewers involved to reach the final decision about article selection, while a domain expert will support the resolution of citation selection conflicts. Additionally, key information will be extracted, categorized, summarized, and analyzed by using a proposed template into an iterative process. Tabular and graphical analyses should be addressed in alignment with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We also performed some tentative searches on Web of Science for estimating the feasibility of reaching eligible articles.Results: Tentative searches on Web of Science resulted in 507 nonduplicated matches, suggesting the availability of (potential) relevant articles. Further analysis and selection steps will allow us to derive a final literature set. Furthermore, the completion of this scoping review study is expected by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.Conclusions: Outlining the approaches of applying formal anonymization methods on CDM-formatted health care data while taking into account data quality and utility concerns should provide useful insights to understand the existing approaches and future research direction based on identified gaps. This protocol describes a schedule to perform a scoping review, which should support the conduction of follow-up investigations.

TI  - COVID-19 SignSym: a fast adaptation of a general clinical NLP tool to identify and normalize COVID-19 signs and symptoms to OMOP common data model
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly, infecting millions of people. An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be valuable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims at adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly build COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8 attributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition, uncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep learning-based models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to quickly build the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our extensive evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19 patients, as well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19 SignSym can achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used for this study can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical natural language processing tools need to be customized for specific information needs within a short time. COVID-19 SignSym is freely accessible to the research community as a downloadable package (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php) and has been used by 16 healthcare organizations to support clinical research of COVID-19.

AB  - Purpose To present the process of establishing a pharmacoepidemiological database in Saudi Arabia, challenges and models used.
   Methods The database establishment has started in 2017 by piloting the conversion of electronic health records of one hospital to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership's Common Data Model (OMOP).
   Results During the pilot phase we have faced several challenges such as limited contribution in providing data by local medical institution due to uncertainty about data governance, diversity of systems used by hospitals, inconsistent coding of medical information, and limited awareness about data structure from participating hospital. The pilot phase was completed in 2019 containing information about patient attributes, medical care, therapies, and other additional services for around 130 000 patients in Saudi Arabia. The majority of patients were below the age of 50 years (89%), and acute respiratory infections were the most frequent diagnosis. The data quality was acceptable and no major anomalies were detected during the conversion.
   Conclusions We demonstrated a successful creation of a pilot database using OHDSI Common Data Model. Our experience with the pilot database could be extended to other institutions to create a national dataset that could be used to generate real-world evidence.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this project was to create time-aware, individual-level risk score models for adverse drug events related to multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapy and to provide interpretable explanations for model prediction behavior. Materials and Methods: We used temporal sequences of observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) concepts derived from an electronic health record as model features. Each concept was assigned an embedding representation that was learned from a graph convolution network trained on a knowledge graph (KG) of OMOP concept relationships. Concept embeddings were fed into long short-term memory networks for 1-year adverse event prediction following drug exposure. Finally, we implemented a novel extension of the local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME) method, knowledge graph LIME (KG-LIME) to leverage the KG and explain individual predictions of each model. Results: For a set of 4859 patients, we found that our model was effective at predicting 32 out of 56 adverse event types (P < .05) when compared to demographics and past diagnosis as variables. We also assessed discrimination in the form of area under the curve (AUC = 0.77 +/- 0.15) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR = 0.31 +/- 0.27) and assessed calibration in the form of Brier score (BS = 0.04 +/- 0.04). Additionally, KG-LIME generated interpretable literature-validated lists of relevant medical concepts used for prediction. Discussion and Conclusion: Many of our risk models demonstrated high calibration and discrimination for adverse event prediction. Furthermore, our novel KG-LIME method was able to utilize the knowledge graph to highlight concepts that were important to prediction. Future work will be required to further explore the temporal window of adverse event occurrence beyond the generic 1-year window used here, particularly for short-term inpatient adverse events and long-term severe adverse events.

AB  - Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain detailed clinical data stored in proprietary formats with non-standard codes and structures. Participating in multi-site clinical research networks requires EHR data to be restructured and transformed into a common format and standard terminologies, and optimally linked to other data sources. The expertise and scalable solutions needed to transform data to conform to network requirements are beyond the scope of many health care organizations and there is a need for practical tools that lower the barriers of data contribution to clinical research networks.
   Methods: We designed and implemented a health data transformation and loading approach, which we refer to as Dynamic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) (D-ETL), that automates part of the process through use of scalable, reusable and customizable code, while retaining manual aspects of the process that requires knowledge of complex coding syntax. This approach provides the flexibility required for the ETL of heterogeneous data, variations in semantic expertise, and transparency of transformation logic that are essential to implement ETL conventions across clinical research sharing networks. Processing workflows are directed by the ETL specifications guideline, developed by ETL designers with extensive knowledge of the structure and semantics of health data (i.e., "health data domain experts") and target common data model.
   Results: D-ETL was implemented to perform ETL operations that load data from various sources with different database schema structures into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) common data model. The results showed that ETL rule composition methods and the D-ETL engine offer a scalable solution for health data transformation via automatic query generation to harmonize source datasets.
   Conclusions: D-ETL supports a flexible and transparent process to transform and load health data into a target data model. This approach offers a solution that lowers technical barriers that prevent data partners from participating in research data networks, and therefore, promotes the advancement of comparative effectiveness research using secondary electronic health data.

AB  - Identifying patient cohorts meeting the criteria of specific phenotypes is essential in biomedicine and particularly timely in precision medicine. Many research groups deliver pipelines that automatically retrieve and analyze data elements from one or more sources to automate this task and deliver high-performing computable phe-notypes. We applied a systematic approach based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct a thorough scoping review on computable clinical phenotyping. Five da-tabases were searched using a query that combined the concepts of automation, clinical context, and pheno-typing. Subsequently, four reviewers screened 7960 records (after removing over 4000 duplicates) and selected 139 that satisfied the inclusion criteria. This dataset was analyzed to extract information on target use cases, data-related topics, phenotyping methodologies, evaluation strategies, and portability of developed solutions. Most studies supported patient cohort selection without discussing the application to specific use cases, such as precision medicine. Electronic Health Records were the primary source in 87.1 % (N = 121) of all studies, and International Classification of Diseases codes were heavily used in 55.4 % (N = 77) of all studies, however, only 25.9 % (N = 36) of the records described compliance with a common data model. In terms of the presented methods, traditional Machine Learning (ML) was the dominant method, often combined with natural language processing and other approaches, while external validation and portability of computable phenotypes were pursued in many cases. These findings revealed that defining target use cases precisely, moving away from sole ML strategies, and evaluating the proposed solutions in the real setting are essential opportunities for future work. There is also momentum and an emerging need for computable phenotyping to support clinical and epidemiological research and precision medicine.

AB  - Background The National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network Blood Pressure Control Laboratory Surveillance System was established to identify opportunities for blood pressure (BP) control improvement and to provide a mechanism for tracking improvement longitudinally. Methods and Results We conducted a serial cross-sectional study with queries against standardized electronic health record data in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) common data model returned by 25 participating US health systems. Queries produced BP control metrics for adults with well-documented hypertension and a recent encounter at the health system for a series of 1-year measurement periods for each quarter of available data from January 2017 to March 2020. Aggregate weighted results are presented overall and by race and ethnicity. The most recent measurement period includes data from 1 737 995 patients, and 11 956 509 patient-years were included in the trend analysis. Overall, 15% were Black, 52% women, and 28% had diabetes. BP control (<140/90 mm Hg) was observed in 62% (range, 44%-74%) but varied by race and ethnicity, with the lowest BP control among Black patients at 57% (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.94). A new class of antihypertensive medication (medication intensification) was prescribed in just 12% (range, 0.6%-25%) of patient visits where BP was uncontrolled. However, when medication intensification occurred, there was a large decrease in systolic BP (approximate to 15 mm Hg; range, 5-18 mm Hg). Conclusions Major opportunities exist for improving BP control and reducing disparities, especially through consistent medication intensification when BP is uncontrolled. These data demonstrate substantial room for improvement and opportunities to close health equity gaps.

AB  - Background The supplementation of electronic health records data with administrative claims data may be used to capture outcome events more comprehensively in longitudinal observational studies. This study investigated the utility of administrative claims data to identify outcomes across health systems using a comparative effectiveness study of different types of bariatric surgery as a model. Methods This observational cohort study identified patients who had bariatric surgery between 2007 and 2015 within the HealthCore Anthem Research Network (HCARN) database in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) common data model. Patients whose procedures were performed in a member facility affiliated with PCORnet Clinical Research Networks (CRNs) were selected. The outcomes included a 30-day composite adverse event (including venous thromboembolism, percutaneous/operative intervention, failure to discharge and death), and all-cause hospitalization, abdominal operation or intervention, and in-hospital death up to 5 years after the procedure. Outcomes were classified as occurring within or outside PCORnet CRN health systems using facility identifiers. Results We identified 4899 patients who had bariatric surgery in one of the PCORnet CRN health systems. For 30-day composite adverse event, the inclusion of HCARN multi-site claims data marginally increased the incidence rate based only on HCARN single-site claims data for PCORnet CRNs from 3.9 to 4.2%. During the 5-year follow-up period, 56.8% of all-cause hospitalizations, 31.2% abdominal operations or interventions, and 32.3% of in-hospital deaths occurred outside PCORnet CRNs. Incidence rates (events per 100 patient-years) were significantly lower when based on claims from a single PCORnet CRN only compared to using claims from all health systems in the HCARN: all-cause hospitalization, 11.0 (95% Confidence Internal [CI]: 10.4, 11.6) to 25.3 (95% CI: 24.4, 26.3); abdominal operations or interventions, 4.2 (95% CI: 3.9, 4.6) to 6.1 (95% CI: 5.7, 6.6); in-hospital death, 0.2 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.27) to 0.3 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.38). Conclusions Short-term inclusion of multi-site claims data only marginally increased the incidence rate computed from single-site claims data alone. Longer-term follow up captured a notable number of events outside of PCORnet CRNs. The findings suggest that supplementing claims data improves the outcome ascertainment in longitudinal observational comparative effectiveness studies.

AB  - BackgroundTo advance new therapies into clinical care, clinical trials must recruit enough participants. Yet, many trials fail to do so, leading to delays, early trial termination, and wasted resources. Under-enrolling trials make it impossible to draw conclusions about the efficacy of new therapies. An oft-cited reason for insufficient enrollment is lack of study team and provider awareness about patient eligibility. Automating clinical trial eligibility surveillance and study team and provider notification could offer a solution.MethodsTo address this need for an automated solution, we conducted an observational pilot study of our TAES (TriAl Eligibility Surveillance) system. We tested the hypothesis that an automated system based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms could detect patients eligible for specific clinical trials by linking the information extracted from trial descriptions to the corresponding clinical information in the electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate the TAES information extraction and matching prototype (i.e., TAES prototype), we selected five open cardiovascular and cancer trials at the Medical University of South Carolina and created a new reference standard of 21,974 clinical text notes from a random selection of 400 patients (including at least 100 enrolled in the selected trials), with a small subset of 20 notes annotated in detail. We also developed a simple web interface for a new database that stores all trial eligibility criteria, corresponding clinical information, and trial-patient match characteristics using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Finally, we investigated options for integrating an automated clinical trial eligibility system into the EHR and for notifying health care providers promptly of potential patient eligibility without interrupting their clinical workflow.ResultsAlthough the rapidly implemented TAES prototype achieved only moderate accuracy (recall up to 0.778; precision up to 1.000), it enabled us to assess options for integrating an automated system successfully into the clinical workflow at a healthcare system.ConclusionsOnce optimized, the TAES system could exponentially enhance identification of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials, while simultaneously decreasing the burden on research teams of manual EHR review. Through timely notifications, it could also raise physician awareness of patient eligibility for clinical trials.

AB  - Objective To describe the infrastructure, tools, and services developed at Stanford Medicine to maintain its data science ecosystem and research patient data repository for clinical and translational research. Materials and Methods The data science ecosystem, dubbed the Stanford Data Science Resources (SDSR), includes infrastructure and tools to create, search, retrieve, and analyze patient data, as well as services for data deidentification, linkage, and processing to extract high-value information from healthcare IT systems. Data are made available via self-service and concierge access, on HIPAA compliant secure computing infrastructure supported by in-depth user training. Results The Stanford Medicine Research Data Repository (STARR) functions as the SDSR data integration point, and includes electronic medical records, clinical images, text, bedside monitoring data and HL7 messages. SDSR tools include tools for electronic phenotyping, cohort building, and a search engine for patient timelines. The SDSR supports patient data collection, reproducible research, and teaching using healthcare data, and facilitates industry collaborations and large-scale observational studies. Discussion Research patient data repositories and their underlying data science infrastructure are essential to realizing a learning health system and advancing the mission of academic medical centers. Challenges to maintaining the SDSR include ensuring sufficient financial support while providing researchers and clinicians with maximal access to data and digital infrastructure, balancing tool development with user training, and supporting the diverse needs of users. Conclusion Our experience maintaining the SDSR offers a case study for academic medical centers developing data science and research informatics infrastructure.
   Lay Summary Research patient data repositories are essential for health systems to learn from the experiences of their patients and for advancing the mission of academic medical centers. In this paper, we describe methods, tools, and practices at Stanford Medicine to maintain its research patient data repository and computing resources to support clinical and translational research, which together comprise the Stanford Medicine Data Science Resources (SDSR). The SDSR includes computing infrastructure and tools to create, search, retrieve, and analyze patient data. Data are made available via self-service and staff supported access, on secure computers. The Stanford Medicine Research Data Repository functions as the SDSR data integration point, and includes patient records such as clinical images, text, bedside monitoring data and administrative records. SDSR tools include a search engine for patient data and data analysis tools for identifying and retrieving data about groups of patients with shared characteristics, such as a diagnosis or treatment. The SDSR also supports patient data collection, reproducible research, and teaching using healthcare data, and facilitates industry collaborations and observational studies. Challenges to maintaining the SDSR include ensuring sufficient financial support while providing researchers and clinicians with maximal access to data and digital infrastructure, balancing tool development with user training, and supporting the diverse needs of users.

AB  - Background The development and adoption of health care common data models (CDMs) has addressed some of the logistical challenges of performing research on data generated from disparate health care systems by standardizing data representations and leveraging standardized terminology to express clinical information consistently. However, transforming a data system into a CDM is not a trivial task, and maintaining an operational, enterprise capable CDM that is incrementally updated within a data warehouse is challenging. Objectives To develop a quality assurance (QA) process and code base to accompany our incremental transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse health care database into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to prevent incremental load errors. Methods We designed and implemented a multistage QA) approach centered on completeness, value conformance, and relational conformance data-quality elements. For each element we describe key incremental load challenges, our extract, transform, and load (ETL) solution of data to overcome those challenges, and potential impacts of incremental load failure. Results Completeness and value conformance data-quality elements are most affected by incremental changes to the CDW, while updates to source identifiers impact relational conformance. ETL failures surrounding these elements lead to incomplete and inaccurate capture of clinical concepts as well as data fragmentation across patients, providers, and locations. Conclusion Development of robust QA processes supporting accurate transformation of OMOP and other CDMs from source data is still in evolution, and opportunities exist to extend the existing QA framework and tools used for incremental ETL QA processes.

AB  - Background: Real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) are playing increasingly important roles in clinical research and health care decision-making. To leverage RWD and generate reliable RWE, data should be well defined and structured in a way that is semantically interoperable and consistent across stakeholders. The adoption of data standards is one of the cornerstones supporting high-quality evidence for the development of clinical medicine and therapeutics. Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) data standards are mature, globally recognized, and heavily used by the pharmaceutical industry for regulatory submissions. The CDISC RWD Connect Initiative aims to better understand the barriers to implementing CDISC standards for RWD and to identify the tools and guidance needed to more easily implement them. Objective: The aim of this study is to understand the barriers to implementing CDISC standards for RWD and to identify the tools and guidance that may be needed to implement CDISC standards more easily for this purpose. Methods: We conducted a qualitative Delphi survey involving an expert advisory board with multiple key stakeholders, with 3 rounds of input and review. Results: Overall, 66 experts participated in round 1, 56 in round 2, and 49 in round 3 of the Delphi survey. Their inputs were collected and analyzed, culminating in group statements. It was widely agreed that the standardization of RWD is highly necessary, and the primary focus should be on its ability to improve data sharing and the quality of RWE. The priorities for RWD standardization included electronic health records, such as data shared using Health Level 7 Fast Health care Interoperability Resources (FHIR), and the data stemming from observational studies. With different standardization efforts already underway in these areas, a gap analysis should be performed to identify the areas where synergies and efficiencies are possible and then collaborate with stakeholders to create or extend existing mappings between CDISC and other standards, controlled terminologies, and models to represent data originating across different sources. Conclusions: There are many ongoing data standardization efforts around human health data-related activities, each with different definitions, levels of granularity, and purpose. Among these, CDISC has been successful in standardizing clinical trial-based data for regulation worldwide. However, the complexity of the CDISC standards and the fact that they were developed for different purposes, combined with the lack of awareness and incentives to use a new standard and insufficient training and implementation support, are significant barriers to setting up the use of CDISC standards for RWD. The collection and dissemination of use cases, development of tools and support systems for the RWD community, and collaboration with other standards development organizations are potential steps forward. Using CDISC will help link clinical trial data and RWD and promote innovation in health data science.

AB  - Background Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda, a vast amount of SARS-COV-2/COVID-19-related data have been collected including COVID-19 testing and hospital routine care data. Unfortunately, those data are fragmented in silos with different data structures or formats and cannot be used to improve understanding of the disease, monitor its progress, and generate evidence to guide prevention measures. The objective of this project is to leverage the artificial intelligence (AI) and data science techniques in harmonizing datasets to support Rwandan government needs in monitoring and predicting the COVID-19 burden, including the hospital admissions and overall infection rates. Methods The project will gather the existing data including hospital electronic health records (EHRs), the COVID-19 testing data and will link with longitudinal data from community surveys. The open-source tools from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) will be used to harmonize hospital EHRs through the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The project will also leverage other OHDSI tools for data analytics and network integration, as well as R Studio and Python. The network will include up to 15 health facilities in Rwanda, whose EHR data will be harmonized to OMOP CDM. Expected results This study will yield a technical infrastructure where the 15 participating hospitals and health centres will have EHR data in OMOP CDM format on a local Mac Mini ("data node"), together with a set of OHDSI open-source tools. A central server, or portal, will contain a data catalogue of participating sites, as well as the OHDSI tools that are used to define and manage distributed studies. The central server will also integrate the information from the national Covid-19 registry, as well as the results of the community surveys. The ultimate project outcome is the dynamic prediction modelling for COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda. Discussion The project is the first on the African continent leveraging AI and implementation of an OMOP CDM based federated data network for data harmonization. Such infrastructure is scalable for other pandemics monitoring, outcomes predictions, and tailored response planning.

AB  - Introduction: To describe the development and implementation of learning health system (LHS) infrastructure for a pediatric specialty care health system to support LHS research in pediatric rehabilitation settings.
   Methods: An existing pediatric common data model (eg, PEDSnet) of standardized medical terminologies for research was expanded and leveraged for this stud, and applied to SHOnet, a clinical research data resource consisting of deidentified data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) from the Shriners Hospitals for Children speacialty pediatric health care system. We mapped EHR data for laboratory, procedures, drugs, and conditions to standardized vocabularies including ICD-10, CPT, RxNorm, and LOINC to the common data model using an established extraction-transformation-loading process. Rigorous quality checks were conducted to ensure a high degree of data conformance, completeness, and plausibility. SHOnet data elements from all sources are de-identified and the server is managed by the SHC Information Systems Department. SHOnet data are refreshed monthly and data elements are continually expanded based on new research endeavors.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Results: The Shriners Health Outcomes Network (SHOnet) includes data for over 10 000 distinct observational data elements based on over two million patient encounters between 2011 and present.
   Conclusion: The systematic process to develop SHOnet is replicable and flexible for other pediatric rehabilitation research settings interested in building out their LHS capabilities. Challenges and facilitators may arise for building such LHS infrastructure for rehabilitation in areas of (a) data capture, curation, query, and governance, (b) generating knowledge from data, and (c) dissemination and implementation of new institutional knowledge. Further research studies are needed to evaluate these data resources for scalable system-learning endeavors.
   SHOnet is an exemplar of an LHS for rehabilitation and specialty care settings. The success of an LHS is dependent on engagement of multiple stakeholders, shared governance, effective knowledge translation, and deep commitment to long-term strategies for engaging clinicians, administration, and families in leveraging knowledge to improve clinical outcomes.

AB  - Objective Deep-learning techniques, particularly the Transformer model, have shown great potential in enhancing the prediction performance of longitudinal health records. Previous methods focused on fixed-time risk prediction, however, time-to-event prediction is often more appropriate for clinical scenarios. Here, we present STRAFE, a generalizable survival analysis Transformer-based architecture for electronic health records.Materials and Methods The input for STRAFE is a sequence of visits with SNOMED-CT codes in OMOP-CDM format. A Transformer-based architecture was developed to calculate probabilities of the occurrence of the event in each of 48 months. Performance was evaluated using a real-world claims dataset of over 130 000 individuals with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD).Results STRAFE showed improved mean absolute error (MAE) compared to other time-to-event algorithms in predicting the time to deterioration to stage 5 CKD. Additionally, STRAFE showed an improved area under the receiver operating curve compared to binary outcome algorithms. We show that STRAFE predictions can improve the positive predictive value of high-risk patients by 3-fold. Finally, we suggest a novel visualization approach to predictions on a per-patient basis.Discussion Time-to-event predictions are the most appropriate approach for clinical predictions. Our deep-learning algorithm outperformed not only other time-to-event prediction algorithms but also fixed-time algorithms, possibly due to its ability to train on censored data. We demonstrated possible clinical usage by identifying the highest-risk patients.Conclusions The ability to accurately identify patients at high risk and prioritize their needs can result in improved health outcomes, reduced costs, and more efficient use of resources.

AB  - Background Improving outcomes of transplant recipients within and across transplant centers is important with the increasing number of organ transplantations being performed. The current practice is to analyze the outcomes based on patient level data submitted to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Augmenting the UNOS data with other sources such as the electronic health record will enrich the outcomes analysis, for which a common data model (CDM) can be a helpful tool for transforming heterogeneous source data into a uniform format.
   Objectives In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of representing concepts from the UNOS transplant registry forms with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM vocabulary to understand the content coverage of OMOP vocabulary on transplant-specific concepts.
   Methods Two annotators manually mapped a total of 3,571 unique concepts extracted from the UNOS registry forms to concepts in the OMOP vocabulary. Concept mappings were evaluated by (1) examining the agreement among the initial two annotators and (2) investigating the number of UNOS concepts not mapped to a concept in the OMOP vocabulary and then classifying them. A subset of mappings was validated by clinicians.
   Results There was a substantial agreement between annotators with a kappa score of 0.71. We found that 55.5% of UNOS concepts could not be represented with OMOP standard concepts. The majority of unmapped UNOS concepts were categorized into transplant, measurement, condition, and procedure concepts.
   Conclusion We identified categories of unmapped concepts and found that some transplant-specific concepts do not exist in the OMOP vocabulary. We suggest that adding these missing concepts to OMOP would facilitate further research in the transplant domain.

AB  - Background Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were pre-specified to be monitored for the COVID-19 vaccines. Some AESIs are not only associated with the vaccines, but with COVID-19. Our aim was to characterise the incidence rates of AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and compare these to historical rates in the general population. Methods A multi-national cohort study with data from primary care, electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a common data model. This study's evidence was collected between Jan 1, 2017 and the conclusion of each database (which ranged from Jul 2020 to May 2022). The 16 pre-specified prevalent AESIs were: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, haemorrhagic stroke, non-haemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, transverse myelitis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Age-sex standardised incidence rate ratios (SIR) were estimated to compare post-COVID-19 to pre-pandemic rates in each of the databases. Findings Substantial heterogeneity by age was seen for AESI rates, with some clearly increasing with age but others following the opposite trend. Similarly, differences were also observed across databases for same health outcome and age-sex strata. All studied AESIs appeared consistently more common in the post-COVID-19 compared to the historical cohorts, with related meta-analytic SIRs ranging from 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66) for narcolepsy to 11.70 (10.10 to 13.70) for pulmonary embolism. Interpretation Our findings suggest all AESIs are more common after COVID-19 than in the general population. Thromboembolic events were particularly common, and over 10-fold more so. More research is needed to contextualise post-COVID-19 complications in the longer term. Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective. Patients with autoimmune diseases were advised to shield to avoid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but information on their prognosis is lacking. We characterized 30-day outcomes and mortality after hospitalization with COVID-19 among patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, and compared outcomes after hospital admissions among similar patients with seasonal influenza.
   Methods. A multinational network cohort study was conducted using electronic health records data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center [USA, Optum (USA), Department of Veterans Affairs (USA), Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalization Linked Data (Spain) and claims data from IQVIA Open Claims (USA) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (South Korea). All patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, diagnosed and/or hospitalized between January and June 2020 with COVID-19, and similar patients hospitalized with influenza in 2017-18 were included. Outcomes were death and complications within 30days of hospitalization.
   Results. We studied 133589 patients diagnosed and 48418 hospitalized with COVID-19 with prevalent autoimmune diseases. Most patients were female, aged >= 50years with previous comorbidities. The prevalence of hypertension (45.5-93.2%), chronic kidney disease (14.0-52.7%) and heart disease (29.0-83.8%) was higher in hospitalized vs diagnosed patients with COVID-19. Compared with 70660 hospitalized with influenza, those admitted with COVID-19 had more respiratory complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and higher 30-day mortality (2.2-4.3% vs 6.32-24.6%).
   Conclusion. Compared with influenza, COVID-19 is a more severe disease, leading to more complications and higher mortality.

AB  - Background Self-harm presents a significant public health challenge. Emergency departments (EDs) are crucial healthcare settings in managing self-harm, but clinician uncertainty in risk assessment may contribute to ineffective care. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) show promise in enhancing care processes, but their effective implementation in self-harm management remains unexplored.Methods PERMANENS comprises a combination of methodologies and study designs aimed at developing a CDSS prototype that assists clinicians in the personalized assessment and management of ED patients presenting with self-harm. Ensemble prediction models will be constructed by applying machine learning techniques on electronic registry data from four sites, i.e., Catalonia (Spain), Ireland, Norway, and Sweden. These models will predict key adverse outcomes including self-harm repetition, suicide, premature death, and lack of post-discharge care. Available registry data include routinely collected electronic health record data, mortality data, and administrative data, and will be harmonized using the OMOP Common Data Model, ensuring consistency in terminologies, vocabularies and coding schemes. A clinical knowledge base of effective suicide prevention interventions will be developed rooted in a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines, including quality assessment of guidelines using the AGREE II tool. The CDSS software prototype will include a backend that integrates the prediction models and the clinical knowledge base to enable accurate patient risk stratification and subsequent intervention allocation. The CDSS frontend will enable personalized risk assessment and will provide tailored treatment plans, following a tiered evidence-based approach. Implementation research will ensure the CDSS' practical functionality and feasibility, and will include periodic meetings with user-advisory groups, mixed-methods research to identify currently unmet needs in self-harm risk assessment, and small-scale usability testing of the CDSS prototype software.Discussion Through the development of the proposed CDSS software prototype, PERMANENS aims to standardize care, enhance clinician confidence, improve patient satisfaction, and increase treatment compliance. The routine integration of CDSS for self-harm risk assessment within healthcare systems holds significant potential in effectively reducing suicide mortality rates by facilitating personalized and timely delivery of effective interventions on a large scale for individuals at risk of suicide.

AB  - Background: Predictive models show promise in healthcare, but their successful deployment is challenging due to limited generalizability. Current external validation often focuses on model performance with restricted feature use from the original training data, lacking insights into their suitability at external sites. Our study introduces an innovative methodology for evaluating features during both the development phase and the validation, focusing on creating and validating predictive models for post-surgery patient outcomes with improved generalizability. Methods: Electronic health records (EHRs) from 4 countries (United States, United Kingdom, Finland, and Korea) were mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), 2008-2019. Machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict post-surgery prolonged opioid use (POU) risks using data collected 6 months before surgery. Both local and cross-site feature selection methods were applied in the development and external validation datasets. Models were developed using Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tools and validated on separate patient cohorts. Results: Model development included 41 929 patients, 14.6% with POU. The external validation included 31 932 (UK), 23 100 (US), 7295 (Korea), and 3934 (Finland) patients with POU of 44.2%, 22.0%, 15.8%, and 21.8%, respectively. The top-performing model, Lasso logistic regression, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.75 during local validation and 0.69 (SD = 0.02) (averaged) in external validation. Models trained with cross-site feature selection significantly outperformed those using only features from the development site through external validation (P < .05). Conclusions: Using EHRs across four countries mapped to the OMOP CDM, we developed generalizable predictive models for POU. Our approach demonstrates the significant impact of cross-site feature selection in improving model performance, underscoring the importance of incorporating diverse feature sets from various clinical settings to enhance the generalizability and utility of predictive healthcare models.

AB  - PurposeDeveloping electronic clinical data into a common data model posed substantial challenges unique from those encountered with administrative data. We present here the design, implementation, and use of the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database laboratory results table (LRT). MethodsWe developed the LRT and guided Mini-Sentinel data partners (DPs) in populating it from their source data. Data sources included electronic health records and internal and contracted clinical laboratory systems databases. We employed the Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC (R)) results reporting standards. We evaluated transformed results data using data checks and an iterative, ongoing characterization and harmonization process. ResultsKey LRT variables included test name, subcategory, specimen source, LOINC, patient location, specimen date and time, result unit, and unique person identifier. Selected blood and urine chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and influenza tests were included. Twelve DPs with outpatient test results participated; four also contributed inpatient test results. As of September 2013, the LRT included 385,516,239 laboratory test results; data are refreshed at least quarterly. LOINC availability and use varied across DP. Multiple data quality and content issues were identified and addressed. ConclusionDeveloping the LRT brought together disparate data sources with no common coding structure. Clinical laboratory test results obtained during routine healthcare delivery are neither uniformly coded nor documented in a standardized manner. Applying a systematic approach with data harmonization efforts and ongoing oversight and management is necessary for a clinical laboratory results data table to remain valid and useful.

AB  - Background Most patients with heart failure (HF) have multimorbidity which may cause difficulties with self-management. Understanding the resources patients draw upon to effectively manage their health is fundamental to designing new practice models to improve outcomes in HF. We describe the rationale, conceptual framework, and implementation of a multi-center survey of HF patients, characterize differences between responders and non-responders, and summarize patient characteristics and responses to the survey constructs among responders. Methods This was a multi-center cross-sectional survey study with linked electronic health record (EHR) data. Our survey was guided by the Chronic Care Model to understand the distribution of patient-centric factors, including health literacy, social support, self-management, and functional and mental status in patients with HF. Most questions were from existing validated questionnaires. The survey was administered to HF patients aged >= 30 years from 4 health systems in PCORnet (R) (the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network): Essentia Health, Intermountain Health, Mayo Clinic, and The Ohio State University. Each health system mapped their EHR data to a standardized PCORnet Common Data Model, which was used to extract demographic and clinical data on survey responders and non-responders. Results Across the 4 sites, 10,662 patients with HF were invited to participate, and 3330 completed the survey (response rate: 31%). Responders were older (74 vs. 71 years; standardized difference (95% CI): 0.18 (0.13, 0.22)), less racially diverse (3% vs. 12% non-White; standardized difference (95% CI): -0.32 (-0.36, -0.28)), and had higher prevalence of many chronic conditions than non-responders, and thus may not be representative of all HF patients. The internal reliability of the validated questionnaires in our survey was good (range of Cronbach's alpha: 0.50-0.96). Responders reported their health was generally good or fair, they frequently had cardiovascular comorbidities, > 50% had difficulty climbing stairs, and > 10% reported difficulties with bathing, preparing meals, and using transportation. Nearly 80% of patients had family or friends sit with them during a doctor visit, and 54% managed their health by themselves. Patients reported generally low perceived support for self-management related to exercise and diet. Conclusions More than half of patients with HF managed their health by themselves. Increased understanding of self-management resources may guide the development of interventions to improve HF outcomes.

AB  - Background: To discover new knowledge from data, they must be correct and in a consistent format. OntoCR, a clinical repository developed at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, uses ontologies to represent clinical knowledge and map locally defined variables to health information standards and common data models.Objective: The aim of the study is to design and implement a scalable methodology based on the dual-model paradigm and the use of ontologies to consolidate clinical data from different organizations in a standardized repository for research purposes without loss of meaning.Methods: First, the relevant clinical variables are defined, and the corresponding European Norm/International Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 archetypes are created. Data sources are then identified, and an extract, transform, and load process is carried out. Once the final data set is obtained, the data are transformed to create EN/ISO 13606-normalized electronic health record (EHR) extracts. Afterward, ontologies that represent archetyped concepts and map them to EN/ISO 13606 and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards are created and uploaded to OntoCR. Data stored in the extracts are inserted into its corresponding place in the ontology, thus obtaining instantiated patient data in the ontology-based repository. Finally, data can be extracted via SPARQL queries as OMOP CDM-compliant tables.Results: Using this methodology, EN/ISO 13606-standardized archetypes that allow for the reuse of clinical information were created, and the knowledge representation of our clinical repository by modeling and mapping ontologies was extended. Furthermore, EN/ISO 13606-compliant EHR extracts of patients (6803), episodes (13,938), diagnosis (190,878), administered medication (222,225), cumulative drug dose (222,225), prescribed medication (351,247), movements between units (47,817), clinical observations (6,736,745), laboratory observations (3,392,873), limitation of life-sustaining treatment (1,298), and procedures (19,861) were created. Since the creation of the application that inserts data from extracts into the ontologies is not yet finished, the queries were tested and the methodology was validated by importing data from a random subset of patients into the ontologies using a locally developed Protege plugin ("OntoLoad"). In total, 10 OMOP CDM-compliant tables ("Condition_occurrence," 864 records; "Death," 110; "Device_exposure," 56; "Drug_exposure," 5609; "Measurement," 2091; "Observation," 195; "Observation_period," 897; "Person," 922; "Visit_detail," 772; and "Visit_occurrence," 971) were successfully created and populated.Conclusions: This study proposes a methodology for standardizing clinical data, thus allowing its reuse without any changes in the meaning of the modeled concepts. Although this paper focuses on health research, our methodology suggests that the data be initially standardized per EN/ISO 13606 to obtain EHR extracts with a high level of granularity that can be used for any purpose. Ontologies constitute a valuable approach for knowledge representation and standardization of health information in a standard-agnostic manner. With the proposed methodology, institutions can go from local raw data to standardized, semantically interoperable EN/ISO 13606 and OMOP repositories.

AB  - Rationale & objective: PRESERVE seeks to provide new knowledge to inform shared decision-making regarding blood pressure (BP) management for pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD). PRESERVE will compare the effectiveness of alternative strategies for monitoring and treating hypertension on preserving kidney function; expand the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) common data model by adding pediatric- and kidney-specific variables and linking electronic health record data to other kidney disease databases; and assess the lived experiences of patients related to BP management.Study design: Multicenter retrospective cohort study (clinical outcomes) and cross-sectional study (patient-reported outcomes [PROs]).Setting & participants: PRESERVE will include approximately 20,000 children between January 2009-December 2022 with mild-moderate CKD from 15 health care institutions that participate in 6 PCORnet Clinical Research Networks (PEDSnet, STAR, GPC, PaTH, CAPRiCORN, and OneFlorida+). The inclusion criteria were >= 1 nephrologist visit and >= 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values in the range of 30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) separated by >= 90 days without an intervening value >= 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and no prior dialysis or kidney transplant.Exposures: BP measurements (clinic-based and 24-hour ambulatory BP); urine protein; and antihypertensive treatment by therapeutic class.Outcomes: The primary outcome is a composite event of a 50% reduction in eGFR, eGFR of <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), long-term dialysis or kidney transplant. Secondary outcomes include change in eGFR, adverse events, and PROs.Analytical approach: Longitudinal models for dichotomous (proportional hazards or accelerated failure time) and continuous (generalized linear mixed models) clinical outcomes; multivariable linear regression for PROs. We will evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effect by CKD etiology and degree of proteinuria and will examine variation in hypertension management and outcomes based on socio-demographics.Limitations: Causal inference limited by observational analyses.Conclusions: PRESERVE will leverage the PCORnet infrastructure to conduct large-scale observational studies that address BP management knowledge gaps for pediatric CKD, focusing on outcomes that are meaningful to patients.

AB  - Healthcare database analyses (claims, electronic health records) have been identified by various regulatory initiatives, including the 21(st) Century Cures Act and Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), as useful supplements to randomized clinical trials to generate evidence on the effectiveness, harm, and value of medical products in routine care. Specific applications include accelerated drug approval pathways and secondary indications for approved medical products. Such real-world data ("RWD") analyses reflect how medical products impact health outside a highly controlled research environment. A constant stream of data from the routine operation of modern healthcare systems that can be analyzed in rapid cycles enables incremental evidence development for regulatory decision-making.
   Key evidentiary needs by regulators include 1) monitoring of medication performance in routine care, including the effectiveness, safety and value; 2) identifying new patient strata in which a drug may have added value or unacceptable harms; and 3) monitoring targeted utilization. Four broad requirements have been proposed to enable successful regulatory decision-making based on healthcare database analyses (collectively, "MVET"): Meaningful evidence that provides relevant and context-informed evidence sufficient for interpretation, drawing conclusions, and making decisions; valid evidence that meets scientific and technical quality standards to allow causal interpretations: expedited evidence that provides incremental evidence that is synchronized with the decision-making process; and transparent evidence that is audible, reproducible, robust, and ultimately trusted by decision-makers.
   Evidence generation systems that satisfy MVET requirements to a high degree will contribute to effective regulatory decision-making. Rapid-cycle analytics of healthcare databases is maturing at a time when regulatory overhaul increasingly demands such evidence. Governance, regulations, and data quality are catching up as the utility of this resource is demonstrated in multiple contexts.

AB  - Background: Bariatric surgery has been used for treatment of severe obesity in adolescents but most studies have been small and limited in follow-up.
   Objectives: We hypothesized that electronic health record data could be used to compare effectiveness of bariatric procedures in adolescents.
   Setting: Data were obtained from clinical research networks using a common data model to extract data from each site.
   Methods: Adolescents who underwent a primary bariatric procedure from 2005 through 2015 were identified. The percent change in body mass index (BMI) at 1, 3, and 5 years was estimated using random effects linear regression for patients undergoing all operations. Propensity score adjusted estimates and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for procedures with >25 patients at each time period.
   Results: This cohort of 544 adolescents was predominantly female (79%) and White (66%), with mean (standard deviation) age of 17.3 (+/- 1.6) years and mean BMI of 49.8 (+/- 7.8) kg/m(2). Procedures included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB; n = 177), sleeve gastrectomy (SG; n = 306), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (n = 61). For those undergoing RYGB, SG, and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, mean (95% confidence interval) BMI changes of 31% (-30% to -33%), 28% (-27% to -29%), and 10% (-8% to -12%), were estimated at 1 year. For RYGB and SG, BMI changes of 29% (-26% to -33%) and 25% (-22% to -28%) were estimated at 3 years.
   Conclusions: Adolescents undergoing SG and RYGB experienced greater declines in BMI at 1-and 3-year follow-up time points, while laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was significantly less effective for BMI reduction.

AB  - The drug safety monitoring based on EMR system is able to collect more objective pharmacovigilance data and analyze adverse drug reaction (ADR) earlier than spontaneous ADR reporting. This study developed the Korea ADR common data model (K-ADR CDM) for early detection of adverse drug reaction which is feasible for Korean EMR systems. To do that, we analyzed previously studied data model from two prominent drug safety surveillance researches: Mini-Sentinel data model and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. The K-ADR CDM of eight tables which contain demographic table, drug table, visit table, procedure table, diagnosis table, death table, laboratory table and organization table. Each table consists of 5 similar to 12 fields. In addition, controlled terminology will be applied to integrate different EMR systems. To validate the data model of K-ADR, EMR data of S hospital was exported and mapped with the K-ADR. Further efforts for the standardization of procedure code and laboratory code will be needed for multi-institutional pharmacovigilance database system. The pharmacovigilance activity based EMR system will be cost-effective method to detect ADR signals.

AB  - Background A computerized 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can automatically generate diagnostic statements, which are helpful for clinical purposes. Standardization is required for big data analysis when using ECG data generated by different interpretation algorithms. The common data model (CDM) is a standard schema designed to overcome heterogeneity between medical data. Diagnostic statements usually contain multiple CDM concepts and also include non-essential noise information, which should be removed during CDM conversion. Existing CDM conversion tools have several limitations, such as the requirement for manual validation, inability to extract multiple CDM concepts, and inadequate noise removal. Objectives We aim to develop a fully automated text data conversion algorithm that overcomes limitations of existing tools and manual conversion. Methods We used interpretations printed by 12-lead resting ECG tests from three different vendors: GE Medical Systems, Philips Medical Systems, and Nihon Kohden. For automatic mapping, we first constructed an ontology-lexicon of ECG interpretations. After clinical coding, an optimized tool for converting ECG interpretation to CDM terminology is developed using term-based text processing. Results Using the ontology-lexicon, the cosine similarity-based algorithm and rule-based hierarchical algorithm showed comparable conversion accuracy (97.8 and 99.6%, respectively), while an integrated algorithm based on a heuristic approach, ECG2CDM, demonstrated superior performance (99.9%) for datasets from three major vendors. Conclusion We developed a user-friendly software that runs the ECG2CDM algorithm that is easy to use even if the user is not familiar with CDM or medical terminology. We propose that automated algorithms can be helpful for further big data analysis with an integrated and standardized ECG dataset.

AB  - Importance Additional data comparing longer-term problems associated with various bariatric surgical procedures are needed for shared decision-making.
   Objective To compare the risks of intervention, operation, endoscopy, hospitalization, and mortality up to 5 years after 2 bariatric surgical procedures.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Adults who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2015, within the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. Data from 33 560 adults at 10 centers within 4 clinical data research networks were included in this cohort study. Information was extracted from electronic health records using a common data model and linked to insurance claims and mortality indices. Analyses were conducted from January 2018 through October 2019.
   Exposures Bariatric surgical procedures.
   Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was time until operation or intervention. Secondary outcomes included endoscopy, hospitalization, and mortality rates.
   Results Of 33 60 adults, 18 056 (54%) underwent RYGB, and 15 504 (46%) underwent SG. The median (interquartile range) follow-up for operation or intervention was 3.4 (1.6-5.0) years for RYGB and 2.2 (0.9-3.6) years for SG. The overall mean (SD) patient age was 45.0 (11.5) years, and the overall mean (SD) patient body mass index was 49.1 (7.9). The cohort was composed predominantly of women (80%) and white individuals (66%), with 26% of Hispanic ethnicity. Operation or intervention was less likely for SG than for RYGB (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.79; P < .001). The estimated, adjusted cumulative incidence rates of operation or intervention at 5 years were 8.94% (95% CI, 8.23%-9.65%) for SG and 12.27% (95% CI, 11.49%-13.05%) for RYGB. Hospitalization was less likely for SG than for RYGB (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.87; P < .001), and the 5-year adjusted cumulative incidence rates were 32.79% (95% CI, 31.62%-33.94%) for SG and 38.33% (95% CI, 37.17%-39.46%) for RYGB. Endoscopy was less likely for SG than for RYGB (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.43-0.52; P < .001), and the adjusted cumulative incidence rates at 5 years were 7.80% (95% CI, 7.15%-8.43%) for SG and 15.83% (95% CI, 14.94%-16.71%) for RYGB. There were no differences in all-cause mortality between SG and RYGB.
   Conclusions and Relevance Interventions, operations, and hospitalizations were relatively common after bariatric surgical procedures and were more often associated with RYGB than SG.

AB  - Background: In a multisite clinical research collaboration, institutions may or may not use the same common data model (CDM) to store clinical data. To overcome this challenge, we proposed to use Health Level 7's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as a meta-CDM-a single standard to represent clinical data.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to create an open-source application termed the Clinical Asset Mapping Program for FHIR (CAMP FHIR) to efficiently transform clinical data to FHIR for supporting source-agnostic CDM-to-FHIR mapping.
   Methods: Mapping with CAMP FHIR involves (1) mapping each source variable to its corresponding FHIR element and (2) mapping each item in the source data's value sets to the corresponding FHIR value set item for variables with strict value sets. To date, CAMP FHIR has been used to transform 108 variables from the Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network data models to fields across 7 FHIR resources. It is designed to allow input from any source data model and will support additional FHIR resources in the future.
   Results: We have used CAMP FHIR to transform data on approximately 23,000 patients with asthma from our institution's i2b2 database. Data quality and integrity were validated against the origin point of the data, our enterprise clinical data warehouse.
   Conclusions: We believe that CAMP FHIR can serve as an alternative to implementing new CDMs on a project-by-project basis. Moreover, the use of FHIR as a CDM could support rare data sharing opportunities, such as collaborations between academic medical centers and community hospitals. We anticipate adoption and use of CAMP FHIR to foster sharing of clinical data across institutions for downstream applications in translational research.

AB  - The Mini-Sentinel is a pilot program that is developing methods, tools, resources, policies, and procedures to facilitate the use of routinely collected electronic healthcare data to perform active surveillance of the safety of marketed medical products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated the program in 2009 as part of its Sentinel Initiative, in response to a Congressional mandate in the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. After two years, Mini-Sentinel includes 31 academic and private organizations. It has developed policies, procedures, and technical specifications for developing and operating a secure distributed data system comprised of separate data sets that conform to a common data model covering enrollment, demographics, encounters, diagnoses, procedures, and ambulatory dispensing of prescription drugs. The distributed data sets currently include administrative and claims data from 2000 to 2011 for over 300 million person-years, 2.4 billion encounters, 38 million inpatient hospitalizations, and 2.9 billion dispensings. Selected laboratory results and vital signs data recorded after 2005 are also available. There is an active data quality assessment and characterization program, and eligibility for medical care and pharmacy benefits is known. Systematic reviews of the literature have assessed the ability of administrative data to identify health outcomes of interest, and procedures have been developed and tested to obtain, abstract, and adjudicate full-text medical records to validate coded diagnoses. Mini-Sentinel has also created a taxonomy of study designs and analytical approaches for many commonly occurring situations, and it is developing new statistical and epidemiologic methods to address certain gaps in analytic capabilities. Assessments are performed by distributing computer programs that are executed locally by each data partner. The system is in active use by FDA, with the majority of assessments performed using customizable, reusable queries (programs). Prospective and retrospective assessments that use customized protocols are conducted as well. To date, several hundred unique programs have been distributed and executed. Current activities include active surveillance of several drugs and vaccines, expansion of the population, enhancement of the common data model to include additional types of data from electronic health records and registries, development of new methodologic capabilities, and assessment of methods to identify and validate additional health outcomes of interest.

TI  - Learning important common data elements from shared study data: The All of Us program analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - There are many initiatives attempting to harmonize data collection across human clinical studies using common data elements (CDEs). The increased use of CDEs in large prior studies can guide researchers planning new studies. For that purpose, we analyzed the All of Us (AoU) program, an ongoing US study intending to enroll one million participants and serve as a platform for numerous observational analyses. AoU adopted the OMOP Common Data Model to standardize both research (Case Report Form [CRF]) and real-world (imported from Electronic Health Records [EHRs]) data. AoU standardized specific data elements and values by including CDEs from terminologies such as LOINC and SNOMED CT. For this study, we defined all elements from established terminologies as CDEs and all custom concepts created in the Participant Provided Information (PPI) terminology as unique data elements (UDEs). We found 1 033 research elements, 4 592 element-value combinations and 932 distinct values. Most elements were UDEs (869, 84.1%), while most CDEs were from LOINC (103 elements, 10.0%) or SNOMED CT (60, 5.8%). Of the LOINC CDEs, 87 (53.1% of 164 CDEs) originated from previous data collection initiatives, such as PhenX (17 CDEs) and PROMIS (15 CDEs). On a CRF level, The Basics (12 of 21 elements, 57.1%) and Lifestyle (10 of 14, 71.4%) were the only CRFs with multiple CDEs. On a value level, 61.7% of distinct values are from an established terminology. AoU demonstrates the use of the OMOP model for integrating research and routine healthcare data (64 elements in both contexts), which allows for monitoring lifestyle and health changes outside the research setting. The increased inclusion of CDEs in large studies (like AoU) is important in facilitating the use of existing tools and improving the ease of understanding and analyzing the data collected, which is more challenging when using study specific formats.

AB  - Research on real-world data is becoming increasingly important. The current restriction to clinical data in Germany limits the view of the patient. To gain comprehensive insights, claims data can be added to the existing knowledge. However, standardized transfer of German claims data into OMOP CDM is currently not possible. In this paper, we conducted an evaluation regarding the coverage of source vocabularies and data elements of German claims data in OMOP CDM. We point out the need to extend vocabularies and mappings to support research on German claims data.

AB  - Introduction This study is part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) initiative, which aims to improve the FDA's postmarket surveillance capabilities by using real-world data (RWD). In the United States, using RWD for postmarket surveillance has been hindered by the inability to exchange clinical data between healthcare providers and public health organizations in an interoperable format. However, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) has recently enacted regulation requiring all healthcare providers to support seamless access, exchange, and use of electronic health information through the interoperable HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. To leverage the recent ONC changes, BEST designed a pilot platform to query and receive the clinical information necessary to analyze suspected AEs. This study assessed the feasibility of using the RWD received through the data exchange of FHIR resources to study post-vaccination AE cases by evaluating the data volume, query response time, and data quality.Materials and methods The study used RWD from 283 post-vaccination AE cases, which were received through the platform. We used descriptive statistics to report results and apply 322 data quality tests based on a data quality framework for EHR.Results The volume analysis indicated the average clinical resources for a post-vaccination AE case was 983.9 for the median partner. The query response time analysis indicated that cases could be received by the platform at a median of 3 min and 30 s. The quality analysis indicated that most of the data elements and conformance requirements useful for postmarket surveillance were met.Discussion This study describes the platform's data volume, data query response time, and data quality results from the queried postvaccination adverse event cases and identified updates to current standards to close data quality gaps.

AB  - Purpose: The primary aim of this work was to convert the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) from Catalonia, Spain, to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). Our second aim was to provide a descriptive analysis of COVID-19-related outcomes among the general population. Patients and Methods: We mapped patient-level data from SIDIAP to the OMOP CDM and we performed more than 3,400 data quality checks to assess its readiness for research. We established a general population cohort as of the 1st March 2020 and identified outpatient COVID-19 diagnoses or tested positive for, hospitalised with, admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with, died with, or vaccinated against COVID-19 up to 30th June 2022.Results: After verifying the high quality of the transformed dataset, we included 5,870,274 individuals in the general population cohort. Of those, 604,472 had either an outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test result, 58,991 had a hospitalisation, 5,642 had an ICU admission, and 11,233 died with COVID-19. A total of 4,584,515 received a COVID-19 vaccine. People who were hospitalised or died were more commonly older, male, and with more comorbidities. Those admitted to ICU with COVID-19 were generally younger and more often male than those hospitalised and those who died.Conclusion: We successfully transformed SIDIAP to the OMOP CDM. From this dataset, a general population cohort of 5.9 million individuals was identified and their COVID-19-related outcomes over time were described. The transformed SIDIAP database is a valuable resource that can enable distributed network research in COVID-19 and beyond.

AB  - BackgroundTo gain insight into the real-life care of patients in the healthcare system, data from hospital information systems and insurance systems are required. Consequently, linking clinical data with claims data is necessary. To ensure their syntactic and semantic interoperability, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community was chosen. However, there is no detailed guide that would allow researchers to follow a generic process for data harmonization, i.e. the transformation of local source data into the standardized OMOP CDM format. Thus, the aim of this paper is to conceptualize a generic data harmonization process for OMOP CDM.MethodsFor this purpose, we conducted a literature review focusing on publications that address the harmonization of clinical or claims data in OMOP CDM. Subsequently, the process steps used and their chronological order as well as applied OHDSI tools were extracted for each included publication. The results were then compared to derive a generic sequence of the process steps.ResultsFrom 23 publications included, a generic data harmonization process for OMOP CDM was conceptualized, consisting of nine process steps: dataset specification, data profiling, vocabulary identification, coverage analysis of vocabularies, semantic mapping, structural mapping, extract-transform-load-process, qualitative and quantitative data quality analysis. Furthermore, we identified seven OHDSI tools which supported five of the process steps.ConclusionsThe generic data harmonization process can be used as a step-by-step guide to assist other researchers in harmonizing source data in OMOP CDM.

AB  - Networks of constellations of longitudinal observational databases, often electronic medical records or transactional insurance claims or both, are increasingly being used for studying the effects of medicinal products in real-world use. Such databases are frequently configured as distributed networks. That is, patient-level data are kept behind firewalls and not communicated outside of the data vendor other than in aggregate form. Instead, data are standardized across the network, and queries of the network are executed locally by data partners, and summary results provided to a central research partner(s) for amalgamation, aggregation, and summarization. Such networks can be huge covering years of data on upwards of 100 million patients. Examples of such networks include the FDA Sentinel Network, ASPEN, CNODES, and EU-ADR. As this is a new emerging field, we note in this paper the conceptual similarities and differences between the analysis of distributed networks and the now well-established field of meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We recommend, wherever appropriate, to apply learnings from meta-analysis to help guide the development of distributed network analyses of longitudinal observational databases.

AB  - The MIRACUM consortium is developing a Clinical Trials Recruitment Support System to support the data-driven recruitment of patients for clinical trials. The design of the prototype includes both open source solutions (OMOP CDM, Atlas) and open standards for interoperability (FHIR). The aim of the prototype is to create a patient screening list of potential participants for a clinical study. The paper shows the modular structure and functionality of the prototype building the foundation for the practical implementation of the CTRSS and, at the same time, demonstrating the use of open source solutions and standards for the development of clinical support systems.

AB  - Background The identification of patient cohorts for recruiting patients into clinical trials requires an evaluation of study-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria are specified depending on corresponding clinical facts. Some of these facts may not be present in the clinical source systems and need to be calculated either in advance or at cohort query runtime (so-called feasibility query).
   Objectives We use the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) as the repository for our clinical data. However, Atlas, the graphical user interface of OMOP, does not offer the functionality to perform calculations on facts data. Therefore, we were in search for a different approach. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the Arden Syntax can be used for feasibility queries on the OMOP CDM to enable on-the-fly calculations at query runtime, to eliminate the need to precalculate data elements that are involved with researchers' criteria specification.
   Methods We implemented a service that reads the facts from the OMOP repository and provides it in a form which an Arden Syntax Medical Logic Module (MLM) can process. Then, we implemented an MLM that applies the eligibility criteria to every patient data set and outputs the list of eligible cases (i.e., performs the feasibility query).
   Results The study resulted in an MLM-based feasibility query that identifies cases of overventilation as an example of how an on-the-fly calculation can be realized. The algorithm is split into two MLMs to provide the reusability of the approach.
   Conclusion We found that MLMs are a suitable technology for feasibility queries on the OMOP CDM. Our method of performing on-the-fly calculations can be employed with any OMOP instance and without touching existing infrastructure like the Extract, Transform and Load pipeline. Therefore, we think that it is a well-suited method to perform on-the-fly calculations on OMOP.

AB  - The current generation of sequencing technologies has led to significant advances in identifying novel disease-associated mutations and generated large amounts of data in a high-throughput manner. Such data in conjunction with clinical routine data are proven to be highly useful in deriving population-level and patient-level predictions, especially in the field of cancer precision medicine. However, data harmonization across multiple national and international clinical sites is an essential step for the assessment of events and outcomes associated with patients, which is currently not adequately addressed. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) is an internationally established research data repository introduced by the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) community to overcome this issue. To address the needs of cancer research, the genomic vocabulary extension was introduced in 2020 to support the standardization of subsequent data analysis. In this review, we evaluate the current potential of the OMOP CDM to be applicable in cancer prediction and how comprehensively the genomic vocabulary extension of the OMOP can serve current needs of AI-based predictions. For this, we systematically screened the literature for articles that use the OMOP CDM in predictive analyses in cancer and investigated the underlying predictive models/tools. Interestingly, we found 248 articles, of which most use the OMOP for harmonizing their data, but only 5 make use of predictive algorithms on OMOP-based data and fulfill our criteria. The studies present multicentric investigations, in which the OMOP played an essential role in discovering and optimizing machine learning (ML)-based models. Ultimately, the use of the OMOP CDM leads to standardized data-driven studies for multiple clinical sites and enables a more solid basis utilizing, e.g., ML models that can be reused and combined in early prediction, diagnosis, and improvement of personalized cancer care and biomarker discovery.

AB  - Background Cancer staging information is an essential component of cancer research. However, the information is primarily stored as either a full or semistructured free-text clinical document which is limiting the data use. By transforming the cancer-specific data to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), the information can contribute to establish multicenter observational cancer studies. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on OMOP CDM transformation and natural language processing (NLP) for thyroid cancer to date. Objective We aimed to demonstrate the applicability of the OMOP CDM oncology extension module for thyroid cancer diagnosis and cancer stage information by processing free-text medical reports. Methods Thyroid cancer diagnosis and stage-related modifiers were extracted with rule-based NLP from 63,795 thyroid cancer pathology reports and 56,239 Iodine whole-body scan reports from three medical institutions in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics data network. The data were converted into the OMOP CDM v6.0 according to the OMOP CDM oncology extension module. The cancer staging group was derived and populated using the transformed CDM data. Results The extracted thyroid cancer data were completely converted into the OMOP CDM. The distributions of histopathological types of thyroid cancer were approximately 95.3 to 98.8% of papillary carcinoma, 0.9 to 3.7% of follicular carcinoma, 0.04 to 0.54% of adenocarcinoma, 0.17 to 0.81% of medullary carcinoma, and 0 to 0.3% of anaplastic carcinoma. Regarding cancer staging, stage-I thyroid cancer accounted for 55 to 64% of the cases, while stage III accounted for 24 to 26% of the cases. Stage-II and -IV thyroid cancers were detected at a low rate of 2 to 6%. Conclusion As a first study on OMOP CDM transformation and NLP for thyroid cancer, this study will help other institutions to standardize thyroid cancer-specific data for retrospective observational research and participate in multicenter studies.

AB  - A growing number of international initiatives (e. g. EU-ADR, Sentinel, OMOP, PROTECT and VAESCO) are based on the combined use of multiple healthcare databases for the conduct of active surveillance studies in the area of drug and vaccine safety. The motivation behind combining multiple healthcare databases is the earlier detection and validation, and hence earlier management, of potential safety issues. Overall, the combination of multiple healthcare databases increases statistical sample size and heterogeneity of exposure for postmarketing drug and vaccine safety surveillance, despite posing several technical challenges. Healthcare databases generally differ by underlying healthcare systems, type of information collected, drug/vaccine and medical event coding systems and language. Therefore, harmonization of medical data extraction through homogeneous coding algorithms across highly different databases is necessary. Although no standard procedure is currently available to achieve this, several approaches have been developed in recent projects. Another main challenge involves choosing the work models for data management and analyses whilst respecting country-specific regulations in terms of data privacy and anonymization. Dedicated software (e. g. Jerboa) has been produced to deal with privacy issues by sharing only anonymized and aggregated data using a common data model. Finally, storage and safe access to the data from different databases requires the development of a proper remote research environment. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the potential, disadvantages, methodological issues and possible solutions concerning the conduct of postmarketing multidatabase drug and vaccine safety studies, as demonstrated by several international initiatives.

AB  - Cultivated by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet), thirteen regional clinical data research networks (CDRNs) are taking shape across the U.S. The PCORnet common data model was carefully planned, and the data marts assembled by the more than 80 data-contributing institutions (nodes) are undergoing, in 2016-2017, a series of data characterization cycles. PCORnet will adjudge each node's- and thereby, in a significant way, each CDRN's-readiness or unreadiness for multi-institution research. Certifying each node's quality and fidelity is of course essential. But in understanding network readiness there is an additional, vital dimension-one that has received too little attention. It is the development of knowledge about the nature of a CDRN's data, in its federated sense. With visualizations, how might one grasp the meta-data of a CDRN? We outline an approach that builds upon the HealthLNK Data Repository, a forerunner to the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN) CDRN.

AB  - Background: Accurate and rapid clinical decisions based on real-world evidence are essential for patients with cancer. However, the complexity of chemotherapy regimens for cancer impedes retrospective research that uses observational health databases.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the anticancer treatment trajectories and patterns of clinical events according to regimen type using the chemotherapy episodes determined by an algorithm.
   Methods: We developed an algorithm to extract the regimen-level abstracted chemotherapy episodes from medication records in a conventional Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) database. The algorithm was validated on the Ajou University School Of Medicine (AUSOM) database by manual review of clinical notes. Using the algorithm, we extracted episodes of chemotherapy from patients in the EHR database and the claims database. We also developed an application software for visualizing the chemotherapy treatment patterns based on the treatment episodes in the OMOP-CDM database. Using this software, we generated the trends in the types of regimen used in the institutions, the patterns of the iterative chemotherapy use, and the trajectories of cancer treatment in two EHR-based OMOP-CDM databases. As a pilot study, the time of onset of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia according to regimen was measured using the AUSOM database. The anticancer treatment trajectories for patients with COVID-19 were also visualized based on the nationwide claims database.
   Results: We generated 178,360 treatment episodes for patients with colorectal, breast, and lung cancer for 85 different regimens. The algorithm precisely identified the type of chemotherapy regimen in 400 patients (average positive predictive value >98%). The trends in the use of routine clinical chemotherapy regimens from 2008-2018 were identified for 8236 patients. For a total of 12 regimens (those administered to the largest proportion of patients), the number of repeated treatments was concordant with the protocols for standard chemotherapy regimens for certain cases. In addition, the anticancer treatment trajectories for 8315 patients were shown, including 62 patients with COVID-19. A comparative analysis of neutropenia showed that its onset in colorectal cancer regimens tended to cluster between days 9-15, whereas it tended to cluster between days 2-8 for certain regimens for breast cancer or lung cancer.
   Conclusions: We propose a method for generating chemotherapy episodes for introduction into the oncology extension module of the OMOP-CDM databases. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the usability, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed framework through a distributed research network.

TI  - Developing an ETL tool for converting the PCORnet CDM into the OMOP CDM to facilitate the COVID-19 data integration
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: The large-scale collection of observational data and digital technologies could help curb the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the coexistence of multiple Common Data Models (CDMs) and the lack of data extract, transform, and load (ETL) tool between different CDMs causes potential interoperability issue between different data systems. The objective of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate an ETL tool that transforms the PCORnet CDM format data into the OMOP CDM.
   Methods: We developed an open-source ETL tool to facilitate the data conversion from the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. The ETL tool was evaluated using a dataset with 1000 patients randomly selected from the PCORnet CDM at Mayo Clinic. Information loss, data mapping accuracy, and gap analysis approaches were conducted to assess the performance of the ETL tool. We designed an experiment to conduct a real-world COVID-19 surveillance task to assess the feasibility of the ETL tool. We also assessed the capacity of the ETL tool for the COVID-19 data surveillance using data collection criteria of the MN EHR Consortium COVID-19 project.
   Results: After the ETL process, all the records of 1000 patients from 18 PCORnet CDM tables were successfully transformed into 12 OMOP CDM tables. The information loss for all the concept mapping was less than 0.61%. The string mapping process for the unit concepts lost 2.84% records. Almost all the fields in the manual mapping process achieved 0% information loss, except the specialty concept mapping. Moreover, the mapping accuracy for all the fields were 100%. The COVID-19 surveillance task collected almost the same set of cases (99.3% overlaps) from the original PCORnet CDM and target OMOP CDM separately. Finally, all the data elements for MN EHR Consortium COVID-19 project could be captured from both the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated that our ETL tool could satisfy the data conversion requirements between the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. The outcome of the work would facilitate the data retrieval, communication, sharing, and analysis between different institutions for not only COVID-19 related project, but also other real-world evidence-based observational studies.

AB  - Observational research in cancer requires substantially more detail than most other therapeutic areas. Cancer conditions are defined through histology, affected anatomical structures, staging and grading, and biomarkers, and are treated with complex therapies. Here, we show a new cancer module as part of the OMOP CDM, allowing manual and automated abstraction and standardized analytics. We tested the model in EHR and registry data against a number of typical use cases.

TI  - Data model harmonization for the All Of Us Research Program: Transforming i2b2 data into the OMOP common data model
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   The All Of Us Research Program (AOU) is building a nationwide cohort of one million patients' EHR and genomic data. Data interoperability is paramount to the program's success. AOU is standardizing its EHR data around the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. OMOP is one of several standard data models presently used in national-scale initiatives. Each model is unique enough to make interoperability difficult. The i2b2 data warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network model.
   Methods and results
   Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we leveraged sites' existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP's visual Achilles data quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO production data to AOU. It is open-source and ready for use by other research projects.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the major burdens in health care, but could be controlled if the relevant data are well-managed. Referring to current successful cases, we designed a framework for the interoperability and integration of medical data in compliance with both archetype and reference information model specification. The clinical data model (CDM) was designed on the basis of OpenEHR archetypes and self-made patient generated health data (PGHD). Integrating healthcare enterprise (IHE) protocol was taken into integrating different modality data. After terminology mapping, the personal health record could be transferred and shared in different clinical information vendors complying with HL7 standards. Many fragment data such as blood glucose and gene data were also integrated to system. Those patients suspected of higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) were grouped as case and other patients could be filtered as control cohort. Furthermore, the framework could be further developed for precision medicine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) supports observational and clinical research using health care data. The PCORnet Antibiotics and Childhood Growth Study is one of PCORnet's inaugural observational studies. We sought to describe the processes used to integrate and analyze data from children across 35 participating institutions, the cohort characteristics, and prevalence of antibiotic use.
   METHODS: We included children in the cohort if they had at least one same-day height and weight measured in each of 3 age periods: 1) before 12 months, 2) 12 to 30 months, and 3) after 24 months. We distributed statistical queries that each institution ran on its local version of the PCORnet Common Data Model, with aggregate data returned for analysis. We defined overweight or obesity as age- and sex-specific body mass index >= 85th percentile, obesity >= 95th percentile, and severe obesity >= 120% of the >= 95th percentile.
   RESULTS: A total of 681,739 children met the cohort inclusion criteria, and participants were racially/ethnically diverse (24.9% black, 17.5% Hispanic). Before 24 months of age, 55.2% of children received at least one antibiotic prescription; 21.3% received a single antibiotic prescription; 14.3% received 4 or more; and 33.3% received a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Overweight and obesity prevalence was 27.6% at age 4 to <6 years (n = 362,044) and 36.2% at 9 to <11 years (n = 58,344).
   CONCLUSIONS: The PCORnet Antibiotics and Childhood Growth Study is a large national longitudinal observational study in a diverse population that will examine the relationship between early antibiotic use and subsequent growth patterns in children.

AB  - Creating computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) requires much effort. This effort would be leveraged by sharing CIGs with more than one implementing institution. Sharing necessitates mapping the CIG's data items to institutional EMRs. Sharing can be enhanced by using standard formats and a Global-as-view approach to data integration, where a common data model is used to generate standard views of proprietary EMRs. In this paper we demonstrate how generic guideline expressions could be encoded in the CELLO standard using HL7-RIM-based views. We also explain how the Knowledge-Data Ontology Mapper (KDOM) can be used to simplify CELLO expressions. We are aiming to use this approach for computerizing radiology appropriateness criteria and linking them with EMR data from Stanford Hospital. We discuss our initial study to assess whether such computerization would be possible and beneficial.

AB  - Background: Despite the many opportunities data reuse offers, its implementation presents many difficulties, and raw data cannot be reused directly. Information is not always directly available in the source database and needs to be computed afterwards with raw data for defining an algorithm.
   Objective: The main purpose of this article is to present a standardized description of the steps and transformations required during the feature extraction process when conducting retrospective observational studies. A secondary objective is to identify how the features could be stored in the schema of a data warehouse.
   Methods: This study involved the following 3 main steps: (1) the collection of relevant study cases related to feature extraction and based on the automatic and secondary use of data; (2) the standardized description of raw data, steps, and transformations, which were common to the study cases; and (3) the identification of an appropriate table to store the features in the Observation Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM).
   Results: We interviewed 10 researchers from 3 French university hospitals and a national institution, who were involved in 8 retrospective and observational studies. Based on these studies, 2 states (track and feature) and 2 transformations (track definition and track aggregation) emerged. "Track" is a time-dependent signal or period of interest, defined by a statistical unit, a value, and 2 milestones (a start event and an end event). "Feature" is time-independent high-level information with dimensionality identical to the statistical unit of the study, defined by a label and a value. The time dimension has become implicit in the value or name of the variable. We propose the 2 tables "TRACK" and "FEATURE" to store variables obtained in feature extraction and extend the OMOP CDM.
   Conclusions: We propose a standardized description of the feature extraction process. The process combined the 2 steps of track definition and track aggregation. By dividing the feature extraction into these 2 steps, difficulty was managed during track definition. The standardization of tracks requires great expertise with regard to the data, but allows the application of an infinite number of complex transformations. On the contrary, track aggregation is a very simple operation with a finite number of possibilities. A complete description of these steps could enhance the reproducibility of retrospective studies.

AB  - BackgroundWe reviewed the results of the Observational Medical Outcomes Research Partnership (OMOP) 2010 Experiment in hopes of finding examples where apparently well-designed drug studies repeatedly produce anomalous findings. OMOP had applied thousands of designs and design parameters to 53 drug-outcome pairs across 10 electronic data resources. Our intent was to use this repository to elucidate some sources of error in observational studies.
   MethodFrom the 2010 OMOP Experiment, we sought drug-outcome-method combinations (DOMCs) that met consensus design criteria, yet repeatedly produced results contrary to expectation. We set aside DOMCs for which we could not agree on the suitability of the designs, then selected for an in-depth scrutiny one drug-outcome pair analyzed by a seemingly plausible methodological approach, whose results consistently disagreed with the a priori expectation.
   ResultsThe OMOP all-by-all assessment of possible DOMCs yielded many combinations that would not be chosen by researchers as actual study options. Among those that passed a first level of scrutiny, two of seven drug-outcome pairs for which there were plausible research designs had anomalous results. The use of benzodiazepines was unexpectedly associated with acute renal failure and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We chose the latter as an example for in-depth study. The factitious appearance of a bleeding risk may have been partly driven by an excess of procedures on the first day of treatment. A risk window definition that excluded the first day largely removed the spurious association.
   ConclusionOne cause of reproducible error may be repeated failure to tie design choices closely enough to the research question at hand. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Insufficient patient enrollment in clinical trials remains a serious and costly problem and is often considered the most critical issue to solve for the clinical trials community.
   In this project, we assessed the feasibility of automatically detecting a patients eligibility for a sample of breast cancer clinical trials by mapping coded clinical trial eligibility criteria to the corresponding clinical information automatically extracted from text in the EHR.
   Methods: Three open breast cancer clinical trials were selected by oncologists. Their eligibility criteria were manually abstracted from trial descriptions using the OHDSI ATLAS web application. Patients enrolled or screened for these trials were selected as 'positive' or 'possible' cases. Other patients diagnosed with breast cancer were selected as 'negative' cases. A selection of the clinical data and all clinical notes of these 229 selected patients was extracted from the MUSC clinical data warehouse and stored in a database implementing the OMOP common data model. Eligibility criteria were extracted from clinical notes using either manually crafted pattern matching (regular expressions) or a new natural language processing (NLP) application. These extracted criteria were then compared with reference criteria from trial descriptions. This comparison was realized with three different versions of a new application: rule-based, cosine similarity-based, and machine learning-based.
   Results: For eligibility criteria extraction from clinical notes, the machine learning-based NLP application allowed for the highest accuracy with a micro-averaged recall of 90.9% and precision of 89.7%. For trial eligibility determination, the highest accuracy was reached by the machine learning-based approach with a per-trial AUC between 75.5% and 89.8%.
   Conclusion: NLP can be used to extract eligibility criteria from EHR clinical notes and automatically discover patients possibly eligible for a clinical trial with good accuracy, which could be leveraged to reduce the workload of humans screening patients for trials.

AB  - Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are initially misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and are treated with antidepressants, whose potential iatrogenic effects are widely discussed. It is unknown whether MDD is a comorbidity of BD or its earlier stage, and no consensus exists on individual conversion predictors, delaying BD's timely recognition and treatment. We aimed to build a predictive model of MDD to BD conversion and to validate it across a multi-national network of patient databases using the standardization afforded by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Five "training" US databases were retrospectively analyzed: IBM MarketScan CCAE, MDCR, MDCD, Optum EHR, and Optum Claims. Cyclops regularized logistic regression models were developed on one-year MDD-BD conversion with all standard covariates from the HADES PatientLevelPrediction package. Time-to-conversion Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed up to a decade after MDD, stratified by model-estimated risk. External validation of the final prediction model was performed across 9 patient record databases within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network internationally. The model's area under the curve (AUC) varied 0.633-0.745 (mu = 0.689) across the five US training databases. Nine variables predicted one-year MDD-BD transition. Factors that increased risk were: younger age, severe depression, psychosis, anxiety, substance misuse, self-harm thoughts/actions, and prior mental disorder. AUCs of the validation datasets ranged 0.570-0.785 (mu = 0.664). An assessment algorithm was built for MDD to BD conversion that allows distinguishing as much as 100-fold risk differences among patients and validates well across multiple international data sources.
